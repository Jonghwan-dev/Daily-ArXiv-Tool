### [1] [SIDeR: Semantic Identity Decoupling for Unrestricted Face Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04994)
*Zhuosen Bao,Xia Du,Zheng Lin,Jizhe Zhou,Zihan Fang,Jiening Wu,Yuxin Zhang,Zhe Chen,Chi-man Pun,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SIDeR, a framework for face privacy protection that decouples identity information from visual representations, generating anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deep integration of facial recognition into various services has raised concerns about privacy protection, and effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations is a critical challenge.

Method: SIDeR decomposes facial images into identity feature vectors and semantic appearance components, leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in a diffusion model's latent space to generate visually anonymous adversarial faces.

Result: Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets show that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.

Conclusion: The proposed SIDeR framework effectively protects face privacy by generating visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency, with high restoration quality for authorized access.

Abstract: With the deep integration of facial recognition into online banking, identity verification, and other networked services, achieving effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations during image storage and transmission has become a critical challenge for privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.

Conclusion: UniTrack consistently improves multi-object tracking performance across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and universality.

Abstract: We present UniTrack, a plug-and-play graph-theoretic loss function designed to significantly enhance multi-object tracking (MOT) performance by directly optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning.

### [3] [VISTA: Enhancing Visual Conditioning via Track-Following Preference Optimization in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05049)
*Yiye Chen,Yanan Jian,Xiaoyi Dong,Shuxin Cao,Jing Wu,Patricio Vela,Benjamin E. Lundell,Dongdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose a training framework to strengthen visual conditioning in VLA models, improving their performance and reliability without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the observation that successful rollouts in VLA models exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones, and they aim to address the issue of vision-action misalignment.

Method: The proposed method involves preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task and latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning.

Result: The method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA and yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

Conclusion: The authors propose a training framework that strengthens visual conditioning in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, improving their performance and reliability.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

### [4] [Food Portion Estimation: From Pixels to Calories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05078)
*Gautham Vinod,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores different strategies for accurate portion estimation in image-based dietary assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of estimating 3D food size from 2D images, which is crucial for accurately monitoring an individual's health and preventing chronic diseases.

Method: The paper reviews various strategies, including the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, and model-based approaches like template matching, as well as deep learning methods.

Result: The result is an exploration of different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation, highlighting the role of deep learning in bridging the gap.

Conclusion: The conclusion is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the paper aims to summarize and analyze the effectiveness of various strategies for portion estimation in image-based dietary assessment.

Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains like healthcare needs to be ensured by auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings.

Method: The authors introduce Visual Concept Ranking (VCR) to identify important visual concepts within large multimodal models and investigate their behaviors on medical tasks.

Result: VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which are validated with manual interventions, revealing unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of VCR in uncovering model shortcomings and visual feature dependencies in large multimodal models applied to medical tasks.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.

### [6] [CLEAR-HPV: Interpretable Concept Discovery for HPV-Associated Morphology in Whole-Slide Histology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05126)
*Weiyi Qin,Yingci Liu-Swetz,Shiwei Tan,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLEAR-HPV, a framework for concept-level explainable attention-guided representation for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, providing compact and interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) in providing limited morphologic interpretability for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology.

Method: CLEAR-HPV restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector.

Result: CLEAR-HPV preserves the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space to only 10 interpretable concepts, and generalizes consistently across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HPV provides a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology, offering compact, concept-level interpretability.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.

### [7] [ARGaze: Autoregressive Transformers for Online Egocentric Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05132)
*Jia Li,Wenjie Zhao,Shijian Deng,Bolin Lai,Yuheng Wu,RUijia Chen,Jon E. Froehlich,Yuhang Zhao,Yapeng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ARGaze, a model for online egocentric gaze estimation that predicts where a camera wearer is looking by conditioning on current visual features and a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of online egocentric gaze estimation is essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies, but it lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues.

Method: The proposed ARGaze model reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction using a transformer decoder that conditions on current visual features and a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates.

Result: ARGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that ARGaze is effective for online egocentric gaze estimation and will release the source code and pre-trained models.

Abstract: Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction. We will release our source code and pre-trained models.

### [8] [AirGlove: Exploring Egocentric 3D Hand Tracking and Appearance Generalization for Sensing Gloves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05159)
*Wenhui Cui,Ziyi Kou,Chuan Qin,Ergys Ristani,Li Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands and proposes AirGlove to improve performance on new glove designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accuracy of sensor-based hand tracking is impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality, and existing bare-hand models suffer from performance degradation on sensing gloves.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under zero-shot and fine-tuning setups, and proposed AirGlove to generalize learned glove representations to new gloves.

Result: AirGlove effectively generalizes hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over compared schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed AirGlove improves the performance of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands, enabling more accurate teleoperation and robotic policy learning.

Abstract: Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.

### [9] [SHaSaM: Submodular Hard Sample Mining for Fair Facial Attribute Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05162)
*Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SHaSaM, a novel combinatorial approach to fairness-driven representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in fairness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage approach: SHaSaM-MINE, which uses submodular subset selection to mine hard positives and negatives, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes.

Result: Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SHaSaM approach effectively mitigates data imbalance and restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data during model training, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes like race, age, gender etc. Existing methods fall prey to the inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize on sensitive attributes, worsening unfairness and performance. To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater photography suffers from reduced contrast, spatial blur, and color distortions, making post-processing challenging.

Method: The authors develop a synthetic corruption pipeline and use diffusion-based generation to reverse its effects, training on a dataset of high-quality awareness photography images.

Conclusion: The paper presents an effective solution for correcting underwater photography degradations using a learned image-to-image pipeline.

Abstract: Underwater photography presents significant inherent challenges including reduced contrast, spatial blur, and wavelength-dependent color distortions. These effects can obscure the vibrancy of marine life and awareness photographers in particular are often challenged with heavy post-processing pipelines to correct for these distortions.
  We develop an image-to-image pipeline that learns to reverse underwater degradations by introducing a synthetic corruption pipeline and learning to reverse its effects with diffusion-based generation. Training and evaluation are performed on a small high-quality dataset of awareness photography images by Keith Ellenbogen. The proposed methodology achieves high perceptual consistency and strong generalization in synthesizing 512x768 images using a model of ~11M parameters after training from scratch on ~2.5k images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in visual recognition, but they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that is imperceptible to the human. Although existing defense strategies such as adversarial training and purification have achieved progress, diffusion-based purification often involves high computational costs and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce Shape Guided Purification (ShapePuri), a novel defense framework enhances robustness by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants. ShapePuri integrates two components: a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance through Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias via stochastic transformations. In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.

*Ju Shen,Chen Chen,Tam V. Nguyen,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGaussian: a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis, achieving real-time rendering at 100 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion, and to improve robustness and generalization in human novel view synthesis.

Method: PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages, fusing body pose with a color encoder to refine depth estimation and using a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, with PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028.

Conclusion: PoseGaussian is a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis, addressing challenges in dynamic human scenes and achieving real-time rendering.

Abstract: We propose PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis. Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines. We validate our approach on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028).

### [13] [GT-SVJ: Generative-Transformer-Based Self-Supervised Video Judge For Efficient Video Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05202)
*Shivanshu Shekhar,Uttaran Bhattacharya,Raghavendra Addanki,Mehrab Tanjim,Somdeb Sarkhel,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel evaluation model, Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge, which repurposes video generative models as reward models to align with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but they struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics.

Method: The proposed model transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models by reformulating them as energy-based models (EBMs) and training via contrastive objectives.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations, which is $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a fundamentally different approach to aligning video generative models with human preferences, and it outperforms existing methods with significantly fewer human annotations.

Abstract: Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

### [14] [Dual-Representation Image Compression at Ultra-Low Bitrates via Explicit Semantics and Implicit Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05213)
*Chuqin Zhou,Xiaoyue Ling,Yunuo Chen,Jincheng Dai,Guo Lu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for generative compression that integrates explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner, achieving state-of-the-art rate-perception performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the limitations of existing generative compression methods, which face a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism, and the need to improve performance under ultra-low bitrate conditions.

Method: The proposed framework conditions a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while using reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details, and introduces a plug-in encoder to control the distortion-perception tradeoff.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively bridges the gap between explicit and implicit representations, achieving superior rate-perception performance and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.

*Jiahao Nie,Wenbin An,Gongjie Zhang,Yicheng Xu,Yap-Peng Tan,Alex C. Kot,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception, outperforming state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TVG methods fail to capture event semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities.

Method: E.M.Ground introduces a special <event> token, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, and multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance event matching and temporal understanding.

Result: E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs on benchmark datasets by significant margins.

Conclusion: The proposed E.M.Ground addresses the challenge of TVG by focusing on holistic and coherent event perception, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which aims to precisely localize time segments corresponding to query events, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.

*Jiahao Nie,Guanqiao Fu,Wenbin An,Yap-Peng Tan,Alex C. Kot,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multi-view Progressive Adaptation to improve Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation by generating diverse views and leveraging them through multiple learning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation have limited performance due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples and the weak few-shot capability in target domains.

Method: The authors propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which includes Hybrid Progressive Augmentation for generating diverse and complex views, and Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction for leveraging these views through sequential and parallel learning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-view Progressive Adaptation (MPA) effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

TL;DR: This paper proposes Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free method for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor performance of dense points in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) due to large domain shifts.

Method: The proposed method, CPS, adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars by sparsifying dense matched points.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CPS is an effective training-free approach for CD-FSS, leveraging the Segment Anything Model and adaptively sparsifying dense matched points based on reference exemplars.

Abstract: Motivated by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in promptable segmentation, recent studies leverage SAM to develop training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, which aims to predict object masks in the target image based on a few reference exemplars. These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object pose estimation is crucial in computer vision, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. Existing score-based generative models suffer from high sampling costs.

Method: RFM-Pose adopts a flow-matching generative model to generate pose candidates and applies proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy.

Result: RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance on the REAL275 benchmark while significantly reducing computational cost and can be adapted to object pose tracking.

Conclusion: RFM-Pose is a efficient framework for category-level 6D object pose generation and tracking, leveraging flow-matching and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and plays a critical role in virtual reality and embodied intelligence, where agents must understand and interact with objects in 3D space. Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.

Abstract: Balancing accuracy and latency on high-resolution images is a critical challenge for lightweight models, particularly for Transformer-based architectures that often suffer from excessive latency. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ReGLA}, a series of lightweight hybrid networks, which integrates efficient convolutions for local feature extraction with ReLU-based gated linear attention for global modeling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for few-shot class-incremental learning by fine-tuning prototypes in a static feature space, achieving superior performance with minimal learnable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of traditional methods in few-shot class-incremental learning, which suffer from representation bias and the inability to effectively assimilate new information under extreme data scarcity.

Method: The proposed method involves freezing the feature extractor and fine-tuning prototypes using a dual-calibration approach, comprising class-specific and task-aware offsets to enhance prototype discriminative capacity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the primary challenge in few-shot class-incremental learning is not feature acquisition but optimizing decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space, and the proposed prototype fine-tuning framework effectively addresses this challenge.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) seeks to continuously learn new classes from very limited samples while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is hindered by high computational costs from processing visual inputs.

Method: The approach involves a highly efficient MLLM architecture with visual token compression and a multi-stage progressive training strategy.

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.

Conclusion: The Magic-MM-Embedding model achieves both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown immense promise in universal multimodal retrieval, which aims to find relevant items of various modalities for a given query. But their practical application is often hindered by the substantial computational cost incurred from processing a large number of tokens from visual inputs. In this paper, we propose Magic-MM-Embedding, a series of novel models that achieve both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding. Our approach is built on two synergistic pillars: (1) a highly efficient MLLM architecture incorporating visual token compression to drastically reduce inference latency and memory footprint, and (2) a multi-stage progressive training strategy designed to not only recover but significantly boost performance. This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation. Comprehensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D achieves up to 2.67x end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

Conclusion: The proposed Fast-SAM3D framework effectively accelerates 3D reconstruction while maintaining fidelity, making it a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the \textbf{first systematic investigation} into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level \textbf{heterogeneity}: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present \textbf{Fast-SAM3D}, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) \textit{Modality-Aware Step Caching} to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) \textit{Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving} to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) \textit{Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation} to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to \textbf{2.67$\times$} end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that improves the efficiency of block diffusion in generative models by reusing stable attention output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the overhead of repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache in long-context settings when using block diffusion.

Method: The method involves analyzing the cross-step redundancy of attention within a block and proposing a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output.

Result: Experiments show up to 1.44x higher token throughput and up to 1.6x reduction in attention time with negligible impact on generation quality.

Conclusion: FlashBlock is an effective and efficient attention mechanism that can be used in diffusion language models and video generation, and is orthogonal to sparse attention.

Abstract: Generating long-form content, such as minute-long videos and extended texts, is increasingly important for modern generative models. Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

Motivation: Prior methods are limited by their assumptions of rectified or pinhole cameras, restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios with fisheye or panoramic cameras.

Method: The authors propose a feed-forward neural network, Wid3R, that leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token for distortion-aware 3D reconstruction.

Result: Wid3R achieves improvements of up to +77.33 on Stanford2D3D and demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness.

Conclusion: Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that outperforms prior methods and achieves strong zero-shot robustness.

Abstract: We present Wid3R, a feed-forward neural network for visual geometry reconstruction that supports wide field-of-view camera models. Prior methods typically assume that input images are rectified or captured with pinhole cameras, since both their architectures and training datasets are tailored to perspective images only. These assumptions limit their applicability in real-world scenarios that use fisheye or panoramic cameras and often require careful calibration and undistortion. In contrast, Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that can model wide field-of-view camera types. Our approach leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token within the network, enabling distortion-aware 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, Wid3R is the first multi-view foundation model to support feed-forward 3D reconstruction directly from 360 imagery. It demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness and consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to +77.33 on Stanford2D3D.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MTPano, a multi-task panoramic foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of comprehensive panoramic scene understanding due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations and the limitations of adapting perspective foundation models to the panoramic domain.

Method: The authors propose a label-free training pipeline that leverages perspective dense priors, categorizes tasks into rotation-invariant and rotation-variant groups, and introduces the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet to disentangle feature streams and facilitate cross-task information sharing.

Result: MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

Conclusion: The proposed MTPano model effectively addresses the challenges of panoramic scene understanding and demonstrates the potential of multi-task learning in this domain.

Abstract: Comprehensive panoramic scene understanding is critical for immersive applications, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations. While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models necessitates the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts, but existing approaches often fail to preserve structural and semantic consistency.

Method: The proposed PAIR framework involves generating safe counterparts from unsafe inputs, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data, and leveraging these pairs for Paired Semantic Realignment and Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PAIR approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

Conclusion: The PAIR framework offers a fine-grained erasure approach that removes targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency, providing a significant improvement over existing concept erasure methods.

Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing prototype-based representation learning methods for OOD detection, specifically the Static Homogeneity Assumption and the Learning-Inference Disconnect.

Method: The APEX framework is designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold, introducing an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM) and a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism.

Result: APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed APEX framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100, validating its superiority in OOD detection.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework called HIVE for multimodal latent reasoning, enabling 'slow thinking' and grounded multi-step inference in the latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that rely on 'fast thinking' and are prone to hallucination, and aims to develop a more robust reasoning process.

Method: The proposed method, HIVE, recursively extends transformer blocks to create an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement, and injects hierarchical visual cues into the model's latent representations.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that robust reasoning can be achieved through multimodal latent reasoning, and that the proposed HIVE framework is effective in enabling grounded, multi-step inference in the latent space.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive perception capabilities. However, their reasoning process often remains a "fast thinking" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, "slow thinking" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies the Simplicity Paradox in OOD detection models, where they are sensitive to semantically subtle OOD samples but blind to structurally distinct samples. It proposes D-KNN, a training-free framework that decouples semantic and structural components, achieving new SOTA performance on CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the Simplicity Paradox in existing OOD detection models, which are sensitive to semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from Geometric Blindness to structurally distinct samples.

Method: The method involves proposing D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework that utilizes orthogonal decomposition to separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism.

Result: The results show that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks, reducing FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%, and boosting AUROC from 79.7% to 94.9% when addressing sensor failures.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that D-KNN is an effective solution to the Simplicity Paradox in OOD detection, providing a significant improvement in detection performance.

Abstract: While feature-based post-hoc methods have made significant strides in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, we uncover a counter-intuitive Simplicity Paradox in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models: these models exhibit keen sensitivity in distinguishing semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from severe Geometric Blindness when confronting structurally distinct yet semantically simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. Notably, in resolving the Simplicity Paradox, it reduces the FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%; when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise, it boosts the detection performance (AUROC) from a baseline of 79.7% to 94.9%.

Abstract: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is a critical challenge with broad applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.

*Xiaoxuan He,Siming Fu,Wanli Li,Zhiyuan Li,Dacheng Yin,Kang Rong,Fengyun Rao,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAIL, a novel framework for aligning diffusion models with human preferences using minimal human feedback and without auxiliary reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning diffusion models with human preferences when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is expensive.

Method: The method involves a self-amplified iterative learning framework where the diffusion model generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences, and refines itself using a self-augmented dataset, with a ranked preference mixup strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The results show that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using only 6% of the preference data required by existing approaches.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models when properly harnessed.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences remains challenging, particularly when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. \textit{This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve effective alignment using only minimal human feedback, without auxiliary reward models, by unlocking the latent capabilities within diffusion models themselves?} In this paper, we propose \textbf{SAIL} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}mplified \textbf{I}terative \textbf{L}earning), a novel framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers through iterative self-improvement. Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VRIQ, a benchmark to assess the visual reasoning ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs), and analyzes their performance on abstract and natural-image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning, and to identify the sources of their limitations.

Method: The authors designed VRIQ, a novel benchmark, to evaluate VLMs on abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks, and introduced diagnostic probes to analyze perception and reasoning failures.

Result: VLMs performed poorly on abstract puzzles (28% accuracy) and natural-image tasks (45% accuracy), with perception limitations being the primary source of failures (around 56% from perception alone).

Conclusion: Current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, are unreliable abstract reasoners, primarily due to perception limitations, and the proposed benchmark and analysis provide a foundation for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has raised the question of whether they can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning. To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.

TL;DR: Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model, improves upon the original Dolphin by introducing enhancements for parsing photographed documents, finer-grained element detection, and code block recognition, achieving substantial improvements on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of document parsing is fragmented across multiple specialized models, and existing two-stage approaches have limitations in handling distorted or photographed documents. The motivation is to improve upon the original Dolphin model and address these limitations.

Method: The proposed Dolphin-v2 model employs a two-stage approach: (1) document type classification and layout analysis, and (2) hybrid parsing strategy based on document type. It conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction for digital-born documents and holistic page-level understanding for photographed documents.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and RealDoc-160 benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.

Conclusion: Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model, improves upon the original Dolphin by introducing robust parsing of photographed documents, finer-grained element detection, and code block recognition with indentation preservation, achieving substantial improvements on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.

Conclusion: The proposed Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer achieves improved image similarity and dosimetric accuracy, enabling MRI-only planning for radiotherapy.

Abstract: MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation; however, the absence of electron density information limits its direct use for dose calculation. As a result, current radiotherapy workflows rely on combined MRI and CT acquisitions, increasing registration uncertainty and procedural complexity.

We propose Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer, a 3D architecture that integrates convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches to model both local anatomical detail and long-range contextual dependencies. Multi-scale shifted window attention with hierarchical feature aggregation improves anatomical fidelity.

*Qianxin Xia,Jiawei Du,Yuhan Zhang,Jielei Wang,Guoming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new dataset distillation method called statistical flow matching, which optimizes synthetic images by aligning statistical flows between class centers, achieving comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods with significantly reduced computational and memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to reduce the computational and memory overhead associated with previous dataset distillation methods, particularly those that use linear gradient matching.

Method: The proposed method involves statistical flow matching, which optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data, and a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference.

Result: The results show that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed statistical flow matching method and classifier inheritance strategy can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of dataset distillation for classification tasks using pre-trained self-supervised models.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing in digital pathology, addressing the issue of correlated pathomics features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the explainability and reproducibility of biomarkers in digital pathology by introducing a method that can edit pathomics features in a controllable and biologically plausible manner.

Method: The proposed method uses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn a disentangled latent space, regularizing feature trajectories to ensure that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. A conditional diffusion model is then used to synthesize high-fidelity images.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAD framework outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence and is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features.

Conclusion: The proposed Manifold-Aware Diffusion framework provides a controllable and biologically plausible approach for cell nuclei editing in digital pathology, addressing the limitations of existing methods that assume feature independence.

Abstract: Pathomics is a recent approach that offers rich quantitative features beyond what black-box deep learning can provide, supporting more reproducible and explainable biomarkers in digital pathology. However, many derived features (e.g., "second-order moment") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.

Result: The TSBOW dataset includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames, and an object detection benchmark is established to highlight challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather.

Conclusion: The TSBOW dataset serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems and paves the way for new research and applications in CCTV-based traffic monitoring.

Abstract: Global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which degrade CCTV signal and video quality while disrupting traffic flow, thereby increasing traffic accident rates. Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Our findings underscore the potential of CCTV-based traffic monitoring, pave the way for new research and applications.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel data-free framework for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions, eliminating reliance on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries, making OOD detection challenging. Current methods rely on external datasets, which is often infeasible due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity.

Method: The proposed framework employs a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy and a Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) to maximize the distinction between in-distribution features and synthesized boundary outliers.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that utilize external real images.

Conclusion: The proposed data-free framework maintains superior detection performance without relying on external datasets, making it a promising solution for practical deployment.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Disco, a framework for cell instance segmentation that addresses the challenges of complex and dense cellular regions by combining topological labeling and deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve cell instance segmentation in digital pathology analysis, particularly in complex and dense cellular regions where existing methods struggle.

Method: The authors propose Disco, a framework that uses a 'divide and conquer' principle, combining a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts.

Result: The authors release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025 and conduct a systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs, revealing that most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Disco effectively addresses the challenges of complex and dense cellular regions by resolving complex adjacency conflicts through a combination of explicit marking and implicit disambiguation mechanisms.

Abstract: Accurate cell instance segmentation is foundational for digital pathology analysis. Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the "divide and conquer" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, "Explicit Marking" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a "conflict set." Second, "Implicit Disambiguation" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.

TL;DR: This paper presents NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that jointly delivers camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing feed-forward systems and neural rendering-based approaches in 3D reconstruction, which either lack novel view synthesis or are sensitive to pose errors.

Method: NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage to improve geometric consistency.

Result: NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance across various benchmarks, with improved depth error, pose accuracy, NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed NeVStereo framework successfully addresses the challenges of obtaining accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: In modern dense 3D reconstruction, feed-forward systems (e.g., VGGT, pi3) focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction but do not explicitly output the novel view synthesis (NVS). Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.

Motivation: Traditional deep learning models lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications like anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis and defect detection.

Method: The proposed Multi-AD model employs SE block, knowledge distillation, and discriminator network to enhance feature extraction and anomaly detection, and integrates multi-scale features for detecting anomalies of varying sizes.

Result: Multi-AD outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level and pixel-level tasks on several medical and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-AD model demonstrates strong generalization across multiple domains and is effective for real-world applications in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness due to severe distortion or loss of projected fringe patterns caused by specular reflection and indirect illumination.

Method: The proposed LD-SLRO method involves encoding phase-shifted fringe images to extract latent representations, using these latent features as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model to suppress reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that LD-SLRO improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LD-SLRO method effectively addresses the challenges of 3-D reconstruction of highly reflective surfaces, providing high-quality fringe images and improved reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry-based 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness remains a significant challenge. When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.

*Donglin Yang,Yongxing Zhang,Xin Yu,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Xiaojuan Qi,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Stable Velocity, a framework that improves training and sampling in flow matching by reducing variance and leveraging insights from the low-variance regime near the data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the high-variance training targets in flow matching that destabilize optimization and slow convergence.

Method: The authors propose Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM) and Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA) for training, and Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS) for inference.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than 2x faster sampling without degrading sample quality on various models and datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Stable Velocity framework effectively improves both training and sampling in flow matching by leveraging the insights from the low-variance regime.

Abstract: While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses using synthetic data and digital twins for automated defect detection in quality control, focusing on non-destructive testing methods and machine learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve quality control in industry through automated defect detection using non-destructive testing methods and machine learning, addressing the need for sufficient and high-quality training data.

Method: The paper presents parametric methods to model 3D mesh objects with various defect types, using a digital twin of the inspected object with synthetic defects, and generating synthetic data through Monte Carlo simulation.

Result: The result is a framework for generating a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set with pixel-perfect annotation, applicable to various non-destructive testing methods, including visual surface inspection.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that using synthetic data generated through the proposed methods can effectively support machine learning-based automated defect detection, enhancing quality control in industrial settings.

Abstract: In industry, defect detection is crucial for quality control. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism to accelerate video generation using diffusion models, achieving an 11.8x speedup while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the rapidly escalating computational burden in video generation using diffusion models, and to overcome the limitations of existing acceleration methods such as Feature Caching and step-distillation.

Method: The authors employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor for diffusion models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation.

Result: The proposed method achieves an 11.8x speedup while preserving generation quality, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the introduced distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism is effective in accelerating video generation using diffusion models while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address catastrophic forgetting in Continual Learning by identifying attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of forgetting, inspired by neuroscientific insights into the human visual system.

Method: The method involves a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions when learning a new task.

Result: Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts, achieving state-of-the-art performance and robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-retaining framework mitigates catastrophic forgetting in Continual Learning by constraining attention drift in Vision Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance and robust generalizability.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

*Dekang Qi,Shuang Zeng,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Memory-Execute-Review framework for Visual Language Navigation (VLN) to improve success rate and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods struggle with balancing success rate and generalization, with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches achieving higher success rates but poor generalization, and Training-Free (TF) approaches generalizing better but with lower success rates.

Method: The proposed Memory-Execute-Review framework consists of a hierarchical memory module, an execute module, and a review module, which work together to provide information support, make routine decisions, and handle abnormal situations.

Result: The framework achieved significant improvements in success rate on multiple datasets, including HM3D_v0.1 and HM3D_OVON, under both Training-Free and Zero-Shot settings, outperforming both TF and SFT baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Memory-Execute-Review framework effectively addresses the challenge of balancing success rate and generalization in VLN, achieving comprehensive leadership in both aspects.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is one of the fundamental capabilities for embodied intelligence and a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets for SAR and optical imagery have limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy.

Method: Designed a coarse-to-fine image matching framework to ensure pixel-level alignment, and established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks.

Result: Supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks, achieving state-of-the-art levels in MRSI matching.

Conclusion: SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models, and will be publicly released.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models. The dataset will be released publicly at: https://github.com/PeihaoWu/SOMA-1M.

TL;DR: This report evaluates feature detection and description for fisheye images in self-calibration contexts, providing a dataset and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the chicken and egg problem of needing good features to perform calibration and needing an accurate projection model for optimal feature detection and description.

Method: The authors conducted experiments to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images using cameras mounted on a car and aiming at the zenith.

Result: The report presents the results of the experiments, although they have not been updated since 2014 and have not been peer-reviewed.

Conclusion: This report provides a detailed bibliography, a dataset called PFSeq, and comprehensive experiments on feature detection and description for fisheye images in the context of self-calibration.

Abstract: What is this report: This is a scientific report, contributing with a detailed bibliography, a dataset which we will call now PFSeq for ''Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence'' and make available at https://doi.org/10. 57745/DYIVVU, and comprehensive experiments. This work should be considered as a draft, and has been done during my PhD thesis ''Construction of 3D models from fisheye video data-Application to the localisation in urban area'' in 2014 [Mor16]. These results have never been published. The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately). It has not been peer-reviewed. Discussions have been translated and enhanced but the experiments have not been run again and the report has not been updated accordingly to the evolution of the state-of-the-art (read this as a 2014 report).

TL;DR: This paper proposes VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system that addresses scale drift and achieves global consistency over long trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of scale drift in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, which remains severe on long sequences.

Method: The method involves a motion-aware submap construction mechanism, anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy, and lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization.

Result: Experiments show that VGGT-Motion improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.

Conclusion: VGGT-Motion achieves efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories, addressing the issues of scale drift and zero-motion drift.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.

TL;DR: The authors propose a lightweight pipeline called Mapper-GIN, which achieves competitive robustness in 3D point cloud classification through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the robustness of 3D point cloud classification without relying on scaling up backbones or specialized data augmentation, instead exploring the potential of structural abstraction alone.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight pipeline called Mapper-GIN, which partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper, constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network.

Result: Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions on the ModelNet40-C benchmark with only 0.5M parameters, outperforming prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters, suggesting that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.

Abstract: Robust 3D point cloud classification is often pursued by scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation. We instead ask whether structural abstraction alone can improve robustness, and study a simple topology-inspired decomposition based on the Mapper algorithm. We propose Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline that partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, and followed by density-based clustering), constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network. On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.

Motivation: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models, and it is unclear how well self-supervised learning representations transfer across different microscopy domains.

Method: The authors generated image embeddings using DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers on ImageNet-1k, Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluated them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels.

Result: All pretrained models transferred well, with the HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell.

Conclusion: The results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant self-supervised learning representations can generalize effectively to related microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even with limited task-specific labeled data.

Abstract: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG) to improve visual autoregressive (VAR) models for image generation, addressing the issue of train-inference discrepancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the train-inference discrepancy in VAR models, which occurs when the model's limited capacity and accumulated error cause it to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature.

Method: The proposed method involves using SSG, a training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence, and Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), a frequency-domain procedure to sharpen and isolate the semantic residual.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SSG is a effective solution to improve VAR models, and its broad applicability across different VAR models and tokenization designs makes it a valuable contribution to the field.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve 3D person detection for safety in applications like robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance, particularly in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

Method: The authors compared three representative models (BEVDepth, PointPillars, and DAL) using the JRDB dataset, analyzing their performance under varying occlusion and distance levels, as well as robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection and underscores the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities in these systems.

Abstract: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in applications such as robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance. This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes FastVMT, a method to accelerate video motion transfer using the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture by removing computational redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to accelerate the computations in the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture used in video motion transfer methods, as previous attempts to accelerate DiT fail to address structural sources of inefficiency.

Method: The authors identify and remove two types of computational redundancy: motion redundancy and gradient redundancy. They mask attention layers to a local neighborhood to mitigate motion redundancy and design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps to exploit gradient redundancy.

Result: FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

Conclusion: FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

Abstract: Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

Conclusion: The IndustryShapes dataset is introduced for 6D pose estimation in industrial robotics, and state-of-the-art methods are evaluated on it, showing room for improvement.

Abstract: We introduce IndustryShapes, a new RGB-D benchmark dataset of industrial tools and components, designed for both instance-level and novel object 6D pose estimation approaches. The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences. We further evaluate the dataset on a representative set of state-of-the art methods for instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation, including also object detection, segmentation, showing that there is room for improvement in this domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models for robotic perception.

Method: PIRATR employs modular, class-specific heads to estimate multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data.

Result: PIRATR achieves a detection mAP of 0.919 on real outdoor LiDAR scans without fine-tuning, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception, enabling scalable, simulation-trained perception systems for dynamic robotic environments.

Abstract: We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

TL;DR: Introduced ViGT, an autonomous driving geometric model estimating 3D occupancy fields from surround-view cameras, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a foundational geometric model for autonomous driving that is scalable, simple, and generalizable across different sensor configurations.

Method: ViGT uses a calibration-free architecture and self-supervised training with synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, trained on a mix of five large-scale datasets.

Result: ViGT achieved state-of-the-art performance on pointmap estimation and comparable performance with supervised methods on Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark.

Conclusion: ViGT represents a significant step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, offering a scalable and generalizable solution.

Abstract: We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis of APD subtypes, as overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as PD.

Method: The study uses a hybrid framework combining CNNs with ML techniques, leveraging multi-modal input data including T1-weighted MRI, segmentation masks, and volumetric measurements.

Result: The hybrid approach achieved AUC scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA, highlighting the potential of combining spatial and structural information.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes, contributing to more reliable early-stage diagnosis.

Abstract: Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.

*Junyang Chen,Xiangbo Lv,Zhiqiang Kou,Xingdong Sheng,Ning Xu,Yiguo Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LoGoSeg, a single-stage framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that integrates object existence prior, region-aware alignment, and dual-stream fusion, achieving competitive performance on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSS methods relying on VLMs like CLIP often suffer from imprecise spatial alignment and lack strong object priors, leading to object hallucination or missed detections.

Method: LoGoSeg incorporates three key innovations: object existence prior, region-aware alignment module, and dual-stream fusion mechanism, ensuring efficiency without external mask proposals or additional backbones.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate LoGoSeg's competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

Conclusion: LoGoSeg offers an efficient and effective solution for OVSS, addressing the challenges of imprecise spatial alignment and object hallucination.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) extends traditional closed-set segmentation by enabling pixel-wise annotation for both seen and unseen categories using arbitrary textual descriptions. While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

*Joe-Mei Feng,Sheng-Wei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on SE(3), introducing the Geometric Observability Index (GOI) to quantify measurement influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how individual image features influence camera pose estimation and why certain observations can distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems.

Method: The authors extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups, derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3), and introduce the Geometric Observability Index (GOI).

Result: GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence, unifying various analyses and yielding diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed GOI framework offers a novel understanding of per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation, providing a tool for analyzing and improving SLAM and structure-from-motion systems.

Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).
  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.
  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training, which combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, and compares its effectiveness to virtual reality (VR) training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency in vaginal births due to constrained clinical rotations and patient reluctance.

Method: The method involves developing an MR system that spatially calibrates an external RGB-D camera with a head-mounted display, implementing a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline for accurate manikin localization, and conducting a large-scale user study comparing MR-based and VR-based childbirth training.

Result: The results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the MR system is effective in childbirth training, offering a promising solution to enhance medical students' practical experience.

Abstract: Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are increasingly constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour. To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current head-mounted camera-based approaches for egocentric pose estimation in VR, including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and lack of real-time performance.

Method: The authors present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline, and utilizes a spatiotemporal encoder and kinematic optimization module to enhance pose estimation accuracy and stability.

Result: Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models, and a user study in real-world scenes demonstrates that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

Motivation: To address the limitation of static channel-wise mixing in ViTs, which relies on fixed MLPs lacking adaptability to input content.

Method: Replaced static MLP with dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction, performing spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention in each Transformer block.

Conclusion: CAViT's unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness, validated by qualitative attention maps showing sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a range of computer vision tasks by modeling long-range spatial interactions via self-attention. However, channel-wise mixing in ViTs remains static, relying on fixed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that lack adaptability to input content. We introduce 'CAViT', a dual-attention architecture that replaces the static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction. Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%. Qualitative attention maps reveal sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven token mixing.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to robustly fit multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fitting methods are mostly designed for classical models, and few methods can handle non-classical models, especially multiple instances.

Method: The authors formulate the multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, using a novel estimator based on model-to-data error and a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer.

Result: The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models.

Conclusion: The paper presents a robust fitting method for multiple instances of non-classical models, with code available online.

Abstract: Most existing robust fitting methods are designed for classical models, such as lines, circles, and planes. In contrast, fewer methods have been developed to robustly handle non-classical models, such as spiral curves, procedural character models, and free-form surfaces. Furthermore, existing methods primarily focus on reconstructing a single instance of a non-classical model. This paper aims to reconstruct multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data. We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum. The effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzongliang/fitting.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve sensor simulation for autonomous driving by addressing limitations in existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods, particularly for spherical cameras like LiDARs.

Method: The method involves extending 3D Gaussian splatting with generalized rolling-shutter modeling, introducing a phase modeling mechanism to handle discontinuities, and using an extended 3D Gaussian representation with two opacity parameters.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet, outperforming recent baselines.

Conclusion: XSIM provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance, and its source code is publicly available.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for testing Automated Driving Systems (ADS) that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism, outperforming state-of-the-art tools in generating high-risk violation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in testing ADS, including limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations.

Method: The method involves using a multi-head attention network to model interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors, and a traffic law weighting mechanism to evaluate violations based on severity and occurrence.

Result: The results show that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker in generating high-risk violation scenarios, achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while maintaining greater scenario diversity.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that ROMAN enables more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation by generating high-risk violation scenarios and identifying more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

Abstract: Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

TL;DR: UniSurg, a video-native foundation model, is proposed for surgical video analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for surgical video analysis rely on pixel-level reconstruction objectives, wasting model capacity on low-level visual details rather than semantic structures.

Method: UniSurg introduces three technical innovations: motion-guided latent prediction, spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation, and feature diversity regularization, built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA).

Result: UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 17 benchmarks, including surgical workflow recognition, action triplet recognition, skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: UniSurg establishes a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.

Abstract: While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.

TL;DR: The paper explores using granular levels of the Big-Five Personality Model to improve personality recognition from audiovisual data, finding that nuance-level models outperform facet and trait-level models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by reliance on broad trait scores and limited training data in personality recognition models, which can lead to poor generalization.

Method: The authors used a transformer-based model with cross-modal and cross-subject attention mechanisms, trained on the UDIVA v0.5 dataset.

Result: The results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that using more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, particularly nuances, enhances personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data.

Abstract: Personality is a complex, hierarchical construct typically assessed through item-level questionnaires aggregated into broad trait scores. Personality recognition models aim to infer personality traits from different sources of behavioral data. However, reliance on broad trait scores as ground truth, combined with limited training data, poses challenges for generalization, as similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context dependent behaviors. In this work, we explore the predictive impact of the more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, facets and nuances, to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data. Using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset, we trained a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms. Results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

*Inbar Gat,Dana Cohen-Bar,Guy Levy,Elad Richardson,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeUP is a scalable 3D editing framework that achieves fine-grained visual control and strict structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D editing frameworks face a trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability.

Method: ShapeUP formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation and is trained on triplets of source 3D shape, edited 2D image, and edited 3D shape.

Result: ShapeUP outperforms current baselines in identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

Conclusion: ShapeUP is a significant advancement in 3D manipulation, enabling precise and scalable editing with fine-grained visual control.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

*Shadi Attarha,Kanaga Shanmugi,Anna Förster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes two methods for detecting camera tampering in still images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method, and compares their performance in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and data required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of smart cameras in outdoor settings for surveillance and security is undermined by tampering, which is harder to detect in still images than in video.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The study evaluates their performance in real-world scenarios and provides publicly available datasets.

Result: The deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more suitable for resource-limited scenarios. Publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images are provided to support the development of camera tampering detection methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the application, with deep-learning models offering higher accuracy and rule-based methods being more practical for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, the use of smart cameras in outdoor settings has grown to improve surveillance and security. Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.

### [75] [Exploring the Temporal Consistency for Point-Level Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05718)
*Yunchuan Ma,Laiyun Qing,Guorong Li,Yuqing Liu,Yuankai Qi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-task learning framework to improve Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) by incorporating self-supervised temporal understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTAL approaches lack explicit modeling of temporal relationships among frames, which is crucial for action localization.

Method: The proposed method designs three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: Action Completion, Action Order Understanding, and Action Regularity Understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: This work is the first to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization, and it shows improved performance in action localization tasks.

Abstract: Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

*Lexiang Hu,Youze Xue,Dian Li,Gang Liu,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes AGFF-Embed, a method for fusing global and fine-grained perceptual information in MLLM embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal embedding models are limited to capturing global semantic information, and complex scenarios require a fusion mechanism that combines global and fine-grained elements.

Method: The proposed AGFF-Embed method generates multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively aggregated. It is also adapted with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique for in-batch hard negatives enhancement.

Result: AGFF-Embed achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed AGFF-Embed method effectively fuses global and fine-grained perceptual information, outperforming other multimodal embedding models in comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.

*Moussa Kassem Sbeyti,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthPrior is a framework that improves small object detection by utilizing depth information, achieving significant performance gains without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of detecting small and distant objects due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter, and the potential of depth information to improve detection performance in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors introduced DepthPrior, a framework that leverages depth information through Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW), Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference, without requiring architectural changes to object detectors.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) showed that DepthPrior achieves up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with high inference recovery rates, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed DepthPrior framework effectively improves the detection of small and distant objects by utilizing depth information as prior knowledge, achieving significant performance gains without modifying detector architectures or incurring additional costs.

Abstract: Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a neuro-inspired reservoir computing (RC) approach using in vitro cultured cortical neurons as the physical reservoir, leveraging their spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity for static visual pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a biological reservoir computing (BRC) system that integrates living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks by leveraging the computational capabilities of biological neural networks.

Method: A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) is used to stimulate and readout the activity of in vitro cultured cortical neurons. Input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, and the resulting neural responses are captured by the remaining electrodes. A linear readout layer is trained to classify these reservoir states.

Result: The BRC system is evaluated on a sequence of visual pattern recognition tasks of increasing difficulty and consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of in vitro cortical networks as reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks and contributes to the incorporation of biological principles into machine learning, supporting the goals of neuro-inspired vision.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.

*Ti Wang,Xiaohang Yu,Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes FMPose3D, a novel generative pose estimation framework that leverages Flow Matching to efficiently generate 3D pose samples from 2D inputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address the ill-posed nature of monocular 3D pose estimation due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, and to improve the efficiency of probabilistic methods.

Method: FMPose3D formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem, using Flow Matching to learn a velocity field defined by an ODE, and introduces a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module to obtain a single accurate prediction.

Result: FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D.

Conclusion: The proposed FMPose3D framework demonstrates strong performance across both 3D human and animal pose domains, and the code is made available on GitHub.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Re-ID approaches either use complex architectures or rely on stylistically diverse single-camera data, which lacks complexity. The proposed method aims to bridge this gap.

Method: ReText is trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data with textual descriptions. It jointly optimizes three tasks: Re-ID on multi-camera data, image-text matching, and text-guided image reconstruction on single-camera data.

Result: ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReText is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across cameras in unseen domains without retraining. While multiple existing approaches address the domain gap through complex architectures, recent findings indicate that better generalization can be achieved by stylistically diverse single-camera data. Although this data is easy to collect, it lacks complexity due to minimal cross-view variation. We propose ReText, a novel method trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, where the latter is complemented by textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues. During training, ReText jointly optimizes three tasks: (1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, (2) image-text matching, and (3) image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data. Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID.

*Hengyi Wang,Ruiqiang Zhang,Chang Liu,Guanjie Wang,Zehua Ma,Han Fang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that improves Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) allocentric perception capabilities, achieving substantial gains on allocentric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, and the need for spatially grounded tasks is rising.

Method: Recovering metric 3D states from images with geometric experts and instantiating a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame, then transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM.

Result: Consistent and substantial gains (~10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, surpassing finetuned models and state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Allocentric Perceiver effectively offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation, improving VLMs' allocentric perception capabilities.

Abstract: With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.

*Enwei Tong,Yuanchao Bai,Yao Zhu,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a plug-and-play pruning framework for vision-language models (VLMs) to improve accuracy-efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often generate massive visual tokens, increasing inference latency and memory footprint. Existing token pruning methods struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression.

Method: FSR is a human-inspired framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context. It combines visual importance with instruction relevance, scans for complementary context, and refines the scanned context via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FSR framework offers a practical remedy for reducing the inference latency and memory footprint of VLMs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs, and to provide a benchmark to drive progress in this area.

Method: The authors recorded each object in two complementary RGB sequences: a handheld sequence and a board sequence. They established baselines using a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and trained NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting.

Result: The experiments revealed significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Conclusion: NVS-HO offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.

Abstract: We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SparseVideoNav, a novel approach for Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN) tasks, utilizing video generation models to achieve long-horizon supervision and significantly improving navigation success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of current vision-language navigation systems that rely on detailed and verbose language instructions, instead seeking to enable agents to navigate unknown environments with simple and high-level intents.

Method: The authors introduce a video generation model into the BVN task for the first time and propose SparseVideoNav, which achieves sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon.

Result: SparseVideoNav achieves a 2.5x success rate compared to state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and demonstrates the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes, with a 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart.

Conclusion: The proposed SparseVideoNav significantly improves the success rate of BVN tasks and marks a substantial advancement in enabling agents to navigate unknown environments with simple and high-level intents.

Abstract: Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning approaches, which suffer from representational mismatch and restricted perceptual acuity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Weaver enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

Conclusion: Weaver, a novel multimodal reasoning agentic system, enhances performance on complex video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that UI-Mem is an effective framework for enhancing GUI online RL, providing a promising paradigm for improving GUI agents through direct environment interaction.

Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

*Pierre-François De Plaen,Abhishek Jha,Luc Van Gool,Tinne Tuytelaars,Marc Proesmans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to stabilize multi-crop training in self-supervised learning frameworks by assigning a separate predictor to each view type, resulting in significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The multi-crop strategy causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3, and the authors aim to address this issue.

Method: The authors propose assigning a separate predictor to each view type and treating each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task, adding cutout views where part of the image is masked before encoding.

Result: The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed method stabilizes multi-crop training and improves the performance of self-supervised learning frameworks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on Siamese networks learn visual representations by aligning different views of the same image. The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that TTC is an effective solution for mitigating error accumulation in long-sequence video synthesis, offering a training-free and efficient approach.

Abstract: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline outperforms several SOTA baselines on medical imaging datasets and improves inference framerate by 3.5X.

Abstract: Boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects is an important problem with applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring and manufacturing, where many of these applications are plagued with scarce labeled data and low in situ computational resources. While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size <500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a simple and effective change detection method called encoder only change detection (EoCD), which performs early fusion of temporal data and uses a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module, achieving optimal balance between performance and prediction speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods either rely on Siamese encoder with sophisticated decoders, resulting in high computational cost and complexity, or use early fusion scheme with inferior performance.

Method: The proposed EoCD method performs early fusion of temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module, significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model.

Result: EoCD demonstrates optimal balance between change detection performance and prediction speed across various encoder architectures, and extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component, and EoCD achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity.

Abstract: Being a cornerstone of temporal analysis, change detection has been playing a pivotal role in modern earth observation. Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quantitative analysis of cardiac anatomy and function, the authors aim to reconstruct 3D cardiac shapes from 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) views.

Method: The authors use a neural implicit function to reconstruct 3D cardiac shapes from sparse CTA planes, with a multi-layer perceptron learning shape priors from 3D segmentations of target structures.

Result: The proposed method achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 across all structures and lower volume errors compared to Simpson's biplane rule, the clinical standard.

Conclusion: The authors' approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography, suggesting potential applications in cardiac diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Accurate 3D representations of cardiac structures allow quantitative analysis of anatomy and function. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium. This suggests that our approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map, which uses learnable matrices to map and combine pre-trained weights, outperforming existing select-based frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP compression methods compromise feature presentation ability, especially at extreme compression, motivating the need for a more effective compression framework.

Method: The proposed CLIP-Map framework uses Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization and Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to preserve information from original weights and mitigate optimization challenges.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with significant gains under high compression settings.

Conclusion: The proposed CLIP-Map framework provides a more effective CLIP compression approach, preserving feature presentation ability and achieving better performance under high compression ratios.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve conditional flow matching for text-to-image generation by learning a condition-dependent source distribution, and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitation of existing flow matching approaches that rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, and to explore the potential of designing a principled source distribution for conditional flow matching.

Method: The method proposed in this paper involves learning a condition-dependent source distribution under the flow matching objective, with techniques such as variance regularization and directional alignment to ensure stable and effective learning.

Result: The results show that the proposed method achieves consistent and robust improvements across multiple text-to-image benchmarks, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this paper is that a principled design of the source distribution is feasible and beneficial for conditional flow matching, and that the proposed method offers practical benefits for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing CTTA methods, which suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, by proposing a prompt-tuning-based approach that updates only visual prompts.

Method: The proposed MGIPT method consists of two components: Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt (AIP) and Multi-scale Global-level Prompt (MGP), which are combined through a weighted ensemble approach to enable effective dual-level adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

Conclusion: The proposed MGIPT method addresses the challenge of distribution shift in medical images and achieves robust adaptation across multiple domains, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable video generation methods depend on control signals at inference time, limiting their utility as scalable data engines.

Method: LSA aligns semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips, using a semantic feature consistency loss combined with the standard diffusion loss to fine-tune the base model.

Result: The model fine-tuned with LSA outperforms baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics and shows effectiveness in enhancing temporal consistency on nuScenes and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: LSA enhances temporal consistency in video generation without needing external control signals during inference or incurring computational overheads.

Abstract: Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of visual generation models has outpaced traditional evaluation approaches, necessitating the adoption of Vision-Language Models as surrogate judges. In this work, we systematically investigate the reliability of the prevailing absolute pointwise scoring standard, across a wide spectrum of visual generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models for screenshot-to-code generation are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code, unlike human developers who iteratively refine their implementation based on visual differences.

Method: VisRefiner constructs difference-aligned supervision associating visual discrepancies with code edits and introduces a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves generated code by observing rendered output and target design.

Result: Experiments show that VisRefiner improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, and endows models with strong self-refinement ability, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from visual differences.

Conclusion: VisRefiner advances screenshot-to-code generation by enabling models to learn from visual differences, showing substantial improvements in generation quality and self-refinement ability.

Abstract: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Context Forcing, a novel framework for real-time long video generation that trains a long-context student using a long-context teacher, eliminating student-teacher mismatch and enabling long-term consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the student-teacher mismatch in existing real-time long video generation approaches, where the teacher is limited to short-context and cannot guide the student on global temporal dependencies.

Method: The proposed method is Context Forcing, which uses a long-context teacher to train a long-context student, and introduces a context management system with Slow-Fast Memory architecture to reduce visual redundancy.

Result: The results show that Context Forcing enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and preserves superior consistency across long durations on various long video evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Context Forcing is a effective framework for real-time long video generation, enabling long-term consistency and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical lack of 3D awareness in existing 2D VFMs, which despite their effectiveness, often fail to capture 3D information.

Method: The method involves lifting 2D features produced by a teacher model into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation in a feedforward manner, then 'splatting' these 3D features onto novel viewpoints to supervise the student model, 'distilling' geometrically grounded knowledge.

Result: The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior works in various downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Splat and Distill, a framework that instills 3D awareness into 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) by using a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline, and achieves substantial gains in 3D awareness and semantic richness of 2D features.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

*Dongyang Chen,Chaoyang Wang,Dezhao SU,Xi Xiao,Zeyu Zhang,Jing Xiong,Qing Li,Yuzhang Shang,Shichao Ka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework for multimodal retrieval, improving retrieval accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval approaches are largely language-driven and lack the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, leading to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases.

Method: The proposed V-Retrver framework reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection, enabling an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools.

Result: Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed V-Retrver framework improves multimodal retrieval by incorporating evidence-driven reasoning, leading to more accurate and reliable results.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.

*Sirui Xu,Samuel Schulter,Morteza Ziyadi,Xialin He,Xiaohan Fei,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liangyan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InterPrior is a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller for humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills through imitation pretraining and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable humanoids to naturally coordinate balance, contact, and manipulation when interacting with objects, by leveraging high-level intentions such as affordance.

Method: InterPrior involves large-scale imitation pretraining to distill a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy, followed by reinforcement learning finetuning after data augmentation with physical perturbations.

Result: The framework yields a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, allowing it to incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects, and demonstrates potential for real robot deployment and user-interactive control.

Conclusion: InterPrior effectively consolidates reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, enabling humanoids to generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination.

Abstract: Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

### [103] [Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037)
*Haoyuan Li,Qihang Cao,Tao Tang,Kun Xiang,Zihan Guo,Jianhua Han,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeoThinker, a framework for spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that shifts from passive fusion to active perception, achieving state-of-the-art results in spatial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing integration strategies for MLLMs remain passive, leading to semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals, motivating the need for a more active and selective approach to integrating geometric evidence.

Method: GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence through Spatial-Grounded Fusion and Importance Gating, applied at carefully selected VLM layers.

Result: GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench, and demonstrates robust generalization across complex downstream scenarios.

Conclusion: The ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence, as demonstrated by GeoThinker's significant improvements in spatial perception.

Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker.

*Jintao Tong,Shilin Yan,Hongwei Xue,Xiaojun Tang,Kunyu Shi,Guannan Zhang,Ruixuan Li,Yixiong Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SwimBird, a multimodal large language model that dynamically switches between text-only, vision-only, and interleaved vision-text reasoning modes to improve performance on both textual and vision-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing multimodal large language models that rely on a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern, which can be ineffective for tasks that require different thinking modalities.

Method: The authors adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset.

Result: SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework for multi-image spatial reasoning, improving accuracy by 9.06% and reducing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of multi-image spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models, particularly in perspective taking.

Method: CAMCUE uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning, injecting per-view pose into visual tokens and synthesizing a pose-conditioned imagined target view.

Result: CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06%, predicts target poses with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold, and reduces inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example.

Conclusion: The proposed CAMCUE framework achieves significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency for multi-image spatial reasoning tasks, enabling fast and interactive use in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes BioACE, a framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations generated by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of large language models for generating biomedical answers requires evaluating the quality of generated answers and supporting references.

Method: The authors developed BioACE, which assesses completeness, correctness, precision, and recall of generated answers and evaluated various approaches for citation evaluation.

Result: The authors identified the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation through extensive experiments and analysis.

Conclusion: The BioACE framework and evaluation package provide a solution for evaluating the quality of biomedical answers and citations generated by large language models.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.

*Zexin Lin,Jiachen Yu,Haoyang Zhang,Yuzhao Li,Zhonghang Li,Yujiu Yang,Junjie Wang,Xiaoqiang Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoWork-X is a framework for cooperative tasks that achieves stable performance gains while reducing latency and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for cooperative tasks have limitations, such as inducing latency or being difficult to compile into reliable execution. The motivation is to develop a framework that overcomes these limitations.

Method: CoWork-X uses a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN-based skill retrieval from a structured skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with budget constraints and drift regularization.

Result: Experiments in Overcooked-AI-like benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while reducing online latency and token usage.

Conclusion: CoWork-X is a promising framework for cooperative tasks that achieves improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models are enabling language-conditioned agents in interactive environments, but highly cooperative tasks often impose two simultaneous constraints: sub-second real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under a strict online token budget. Existing approaches either rely on frequent in-episode reasoning that induces latency and timing jitter, or deliver post-episode improvements through unstructured text that is difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution. We propose CoWork-X, an active co-evolution framework that casts peer collaboration as a closed-loop optimization problem across episodes, inspired by fast--slow memory separation. CoWork-X instantiates a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN (hierarchical task network)-based skill retrieval from a structured, interpretable, and compositional skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization. Experiments in challenging Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while steadily reducing online latency and token usage.

*Sean Trott,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual language models under-perform monolingual ones due to capacity limitations, affecting lexical disambiguation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the 'multilingual penalty' in multilingual language models for lexical disambiguation tasks.

Method: Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words.

Result: Multilingual LMs show reduced performance and suffer from representational, attentional, and vocabulary-related capacity constraints.

Conclusion: Multilingual LMs suffer from multiple capacity constraints that correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory, addressing the need for efficient continual learning in large language models.

Method: The authors present Locas, a locally-supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers. They discuss two variants of Locas and validate its performance on language modeling and question answering tasks.

Result: The results show that Locas is capable of storing information from past context with minimal additional parameters, maintaining a smaller context window, and minimizing catastrophic forgetting of existing internal knowledge.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Locas is a promising approach for permanentizing past context into parametric knowledge, enabling efficient continual learning with minimized catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled training data for language technology and generative AI models, and the difficulty in predicting the properties of synthetic data generated by black-box transformer models.

Method: Mathematical derivation of DKPS and its application to provide performance guarantees for transformer models and downstream tasks such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO).

Result: DKPS provides concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models, and elucidates the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed DKPS provides a foundation for mathematical analysis and statistical guarantees for the quality of synthetic data generated by transformer models, with potential applications in improving downstream models.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.

Motivation: Implicit discourse relation classification is challenging as it requires inferring meaning from context, and contextual cues are not always captured by text alone.

Method: The authors introduce an automatic method to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset and propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio.

Result: The results show that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal approach for implicit discourse relation classification across languages.

Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

Result: Evaluations of over 80 LLMs revealed substantial performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, as well as between Greek-adapted models and general multilingual ones.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights for improving LLM capabilities in Greek by analyzing factors influencing performance, including model scale, adaptation, and prompting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multilingual corpora that include Greek, yet reliable evaluation benchmarks for Greek-particularly those based on authentic, native-sourced content-remain limited. Existing datasets are often machine-translated from English, failing to capture Greek linguistic and cultural characteristics. We introduce GreekMMLU, a native-sourced benchmark for massive multitask language understanding in Greek, comprising 21,805 multiple-choice questions across 45 subject areas, organized under a newly defined subject taxonomy and annotated with educational difficulty levels spanning primary to professional examinations. All questions are sourced or authored in Greek from academic, professional, and governmental exams. We publicly release 16,857 samples and reserve 4,948 samples for a private leaderboard to enable robust and contamination-resistant evaluation. Evaluations of over 80 open- and closed-source LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, as well as between Greek-adapted models and general multilingual ones. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of factors influencing performance-including model scale, adaptation, and prompting-and derive insights for improving LLM capabilities in Greek.

TL;DR: This paper studies the risks of using multiple language models (LMs) in collaboration and finds that malicious models can severely impact system performance, especially in reasoning and safety domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the safety risks associated with the increasing use of multiple LMs in collaboration, particularly when some models may be compromised or malicious.

Method: The authors engineered four categories of malicious LMs, plugged them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluated the compromised system across 10 datasets.

Result: The results show that malicious models significantly lower the performance of multi-LLM systems, especially in reasoning and safety domains, but proposed mitigation strategies can recover most of the initial performance.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while mitigation strategies can alleviate the impact of malicious models, making model collaboration systems fully resistant to them remains an open research question.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of diverse language models while reducing the cost of loading multiple models.

Method: The authors distill collaborative patterns into a single model by training it on the outputs of the model collaboration system, and propose a single-multi evolution loop where multiple models collaborate, distill, and evolve iteratively.

Result: The proposed method improves individual models by 8.0% on average, and the overall collaboration system by 14.9% on average. The single-multi evolution loop outperforms existing evolutionary AI methods and is compatible with diverse settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, enabling the strengths of model collaboration to be preserved while reducing the cost to a single model.

Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.

*Hsuan-Yu Chou,Wajiha Naveed,Shuyan Zhou,Xiaowei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of open-weight large language models (LLMs) for social media moderation tasks, comparing them to proprietary LLMs, and finds that open-weight LLMs can achieve similar performance while supporting privacy-preserving moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for effective moderation of harmful content on the internet motivates this research, which aims to explore the capability of open-weight LLMs for social media moderation tasks.

Method: The authors evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs (four proprietary and three open-weight) using real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors.

Result: The study finds a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity and specificity of open-weight LLMs and proprietary ones, with specificity exceeding sensitivity for rudeness detection but not for intolerance and threats. The authors also identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware, highlighting new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

### [116] [Aligning Large Language Model Behavior with Human Citation Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05205)
*Kenichiro Ando,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the citation behavior of large-scale language models (LLMs) and its alignment with human preferences, providing insights into how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled, as recent research has focused on what reference documents to link to outputs.

Method: The authors construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior, categorizing web-derived texts into eight citation-motivation types and evaluating pairwise citation preferences.

Result: The results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. Current models are more likely to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations, but underselect numeric sentences and sentences containing personal names.

Conclusion: This study provides a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences and demonstrates that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences.

Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.

### [117] [Quantifying the Knowledge Proximity Between Academic and Industry Research: An Entity and Semantic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05211)
*Hongye Zhao,Yi Zhao,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the knowledge proximity between academia and industry, proposing a fine-grained method to quantify their co-evolution through entities and semantic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on academia-industry knowledge proximity rely on macro indicators, lacking fine-grained analysis, which may undermine collaboration and resource allocation efficiency.

Method: The study extracts fine-grained knowledge entities using pre-trained models, measures sequence overlaps with cosine similarity, analyzes topological features via complex network analysis, and employs unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify semantic convergence.

Result: The analysis reveals rising knowledge proximity between academia and industry, especially after technological changes, and shows that academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

Conclusion: This study provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in the co-evolution of academia and industry, offering insights into their knowledge proximity and its dynamics.

Abstract: The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution. Additionally, academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions and establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and high-level conceptual space, achieving unified understanding and generation for general audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move away from rigid, task-specific supervision and instead process audio holistically like human intelligence, bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts.

Method: The method involves pre-training Bagpiper on a massive corpus of 600B tokens and fine-tuning it with a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step.

Result: Bagpiper outperforms existing models like Qwen-2.5-Omni, CosyVoice3, and TangoFlux in audio understanding and generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Bagpiper is among the first works to achieve unified understanding and generation for general audio, with the model, data, and code available publicly.

Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.

*Zhilin Liang,Yuxiang Wang,Zimu Zhou,Hainan Zhang,Boyi Liu,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedMosaic is a federated RAG framework that improves accuracy and reduces storage and communication costs without sharing raw documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a federated RAG framework that collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents, addressing the limitations of centralized corpus and privacy concerns.

Method: The method involves adopting a parametric RAG approach, clustering semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks, and performing selective adapter aggregation.

Result: The results show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%.

Conclusion: FedMosaic is an effective federated RAG framework that improves accuracy, reduces storage and communication costs, and preserves document privacy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.

Conclusion: Copyright Detective is the first interactive forensic system for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs, treating copyright infringement as an evidence discovery process.

Abstract: We present Copyright Detective, the first interactive forensic system for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs. The system treats copyright infringement versus compliance as an evidence discovery process rather than a static classification task due to the complex nature of copyright law. It integrates multiple detection paradigms, including content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification, within a unified and extensible framework. Through interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows, our system enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage, supporting responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks even with black-box access.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoPE, a method that unifies out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling in Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for Large Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art length generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to unify the distinct objectives of out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling in RoPE.

Method: The method involves a minimalist intervention called CoPE, which applies soft clipping to low-frequency components of RoPE.

Result: The result is significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating the theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that CoPE effectively eliminates OOD outliers, refines semantic signals, and prevents spectral leakage, achieving state-of-the-art length generalization.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of response length on reasoning capabilities in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and proposes a new algorithm, Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO), to address length bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the varying patterns of change in response length across different RLVR algorithms during training, seeking to provide a fundamental explanation for these variations.

Method: The paper conducts a theoretical analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms and validates the theory through extensive experimentation. It then proposes the LUSPO algorithm to rectify length bias.

Result: The LUSPO algorithm achieves superior performance across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, representing a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LUSPO resolves the issue of response length collapse by rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length, outperforming existing methods like GRPO and GSPO.

Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) by introducing a 'collaboration gain' metric and a factor attribution paradigm to shift from empirical trial-and-error to a principled scientific approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of MAS lacks a unified scientific framework for systematic optimization and improvement due to the ambiguity of attribution and absence of a structured taxonomy of factors and a unified metric.

Method: The authors propose an integrated framework that includes establishing a 'collaboration gain' metric ($Γ$) to isolate intrinsic gains, a factor attribution paradigm to identify collaboration-driving factors, and constructing a systematic MAS factor library.

Result: The proposed framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science in MAS, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

Conclusion: By introducing a collaboration gain metric and a systematic factor library, the paper advocates for a shift towards design science in MAS, enabling systematic optimization and improvement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

*Haojin Wang,Yike Wang,Shangbin Feng,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose MentorCollab, a method that enables a large reasoning model to selectively guide a small language model at inference time, improving performance while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to combine the strengths of large reasoning models (LRMs) and small language models (SLMs). LRMs achieve strong performance but have high inference costs, while SLMs are efficient but struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing collaboration methods often result in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction.

Method: The authors propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method where a large reasoning model (LRM) selectively guides a small language model (SLM). The LRM probes for divergences between the two models at randomly sampled token positions and uses a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from the LRM or continue on its own.

Result: The results show that MentorCollab improves performance in 12 out of 15 settings across 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning). The average gains are 3.0%, with a maximum gain of 8.0%. The method achieves this while using only 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average.

Conclusion: The proposed MentorCollab method improves performance in 12 out of 15 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while using only 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how language models acquire character-level knowledge and identifies factors contributing to this phenomenon, including those dependent and independent of tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the mechanisms underlying language models' ability to implicitly encode character-level information despite not being explicitly provided during training.

Method: The method involves comparing language models trained under controlled settings with those trained under standard settings, and categorizing contributing factors into those dependent and independent of tokenization.

Result: The analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints are primary factors arising from tokenization, while semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information are key factors independent of tokenization.

Conclusion: The study concludes by identifying the key factors that contribute to language models' character-level knowledge, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have been reported to implicitly encode character-level information, despite not being explicitly provided during training. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. To reveal the mechanisms, we analyze how models acquire character-level knowledge by comparing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, with those trained under standard settings. We categorize the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization. Our analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary factors arising from tokenization, whereas semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information function as key factors independent of tokenization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the scaling hypothesis in Iterative Direct Preference Optimization for Large Language Models and introduces PACE, a more efficient and robust method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the counter-intuitive phenomenon that aggressive exploration in mathematical reasoning yields diminishing returns and can cause policy collapse.

Method: The method involves introducing PACE, which uses a generation-based corrective strategy to synthesize high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations, operating with a minimal budget.

Result: PACE outperforms DPO-R1 while using significantly less compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that PACE is a more efficient and robust alternative to standard implementations of Iterative Direct Preference Optimization for aligning Large Language Models.

Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Motivation: LLMs are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities, and recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks.

Method: Cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering, tokenization analysis, and reliability analysis.

Result: A persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity, structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, and limited correlation between model-reported confidence and explanations with correctness.

Conclusion: The need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks is underscored by the findings.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and are costly in enterprise deployment.

Method: IESR framework leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, integrates multi-path reasoning with Monte Carlo Tree Search and majority voting, and introduces a trajectory consistency verification module.

Result: IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on LogicCat and Archer datasets using compact lightweight models without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: IESR effectively addresses complex reasoning challenges in Text-to-SQL tasks, and highlights future research directions on biases and deficiencies in current coder models.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

*Jiyun Chun,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White,Andrew Perrault*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue, assessing response quality along Expansion and Independence axes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating children's utterances due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics, as common proxies are dominated by length and ignore conversational context.

Method: The method involves classifying the Previous Adult Utterance Type and scoring the child's response along Expansion and Independence axes, reflecting dimensions in child language development.

Result: The results show developmental validity by establishing age-related patterns, predictive value by improving age estimation, and semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the introduced metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation and shifting child utterance assessment from measuring length to evaluating meaningful contributions to conversation.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm to accelerate the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging existing small pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational expense of pretraining LLMs by utilizing existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models.

Method: The proposed LET paradigm guides the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained model, enabling LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness, achieving up to 1.6$x$ speedup with nearly 5% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training.

Conclusion: The LET paradigm significantly accelerates training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose OPUS, a dynamic data selection framework that improves pre-training efficiency and achieves superior performance in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of the Data Wall, where high-quality public text is approaching exhaustion, and pre-training is shifting from more tokens to better tokens.

Method: The authors propose OPUS, a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space, using techniques such as Ghost with CountSketch for computational efficiency and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity.

Result: OPUS achieves superior performance in pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu, and in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, using fewer tokens than full training.

Conclusion: OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales, outperforming industrial-level baselines and demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.

Abstract: As high-quality public text approaches exhaustion, a phenomenon known as the Data Wall, pre-training is shifting from more tokens to better tokens. However, existing methods either rely on heuristic static filters that ignore training dynamics, or use dynamic yet optimizer-agnostic criteria based on raw gradients. We propose OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. OPUS scores candidates by projecting their effective updates, shaped by modern optimizers, onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. To ensure scalability, we employ Ghost technique with CountSketch for computational efficiency, and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity, incurring only 4.7\% additional compute overhead. OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales. In pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens, OPUS outperforms industrial-level baselines and even full 200B-token training. Moreover, when combined with industrial-level static filters, OPUS further improves pre-training efficiency, even with lower-quality data. Furthermore, in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens, demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.

### [132] [Grammatical Error Correction Evaluation by Optimally Transporting Edit Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05419)
*Takumi Goto,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, for evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, which improves evaluation performance and provides interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the ineffectiveness of current similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, in evaluating GEC systems, as they do not account for unchanged words in the source sentences.

Method: The authors propose a new representation called edit vector and introduce UOT-ERRANT, a metric that uses unbalanced optimal transport to measure similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences based on edits from the source sentence.

Result: Experiments using SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain, and provides a highly interpretable transport plan that can be used as a soft edit alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed UOT-ERRANT metric is a useful tool for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems, offering improved evaluation performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems.

### [133] [Once Correct, Still Wrong: Counterfactual Hallucination in Multilingual Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05437)
*Basel Mousi,Fahim Dalvi,Shammur Chowdhury,Firoj Alam,Nadir Durrani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors introduce M2CQA, a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' (VLMs) hallucination in non-Western contexts, and propose a new metric, CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), to measure hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test VLMs' failure mode of accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations, particularly outside Western contexts and English.

Method: The authors built M2CQA from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects, and evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies.

Result: CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Reasoning-first prompting increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their benchmark and metric can effectively evaluate VLMs' hallucination and provide insights into the impact of different prompting strategies on robustness.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Causal Front-Door Adjustment Attack (CFA^2) to jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever confounding associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that safety alignment mechanisms in LLMs often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities.

Method: The authors model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective and employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CFA^2 achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

Conclusion: The proposed CFA^2 framework is effective in jailbreaking LLMs by severing confounding associations, providing a new perspective on the safety mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification, addressing challenges of emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision.

Method: The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization, an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism, and a mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization.

Result: Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, Reasoning under Ambiguity, explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty, enabling robust learning under partial supervision and improving performance on multilingual multi-label emotion classification tasks.

Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

TL;DR: A cross-architecture merging framework is proposed to transfer knowledge from large language models to smaller models, achieving improved performance in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between the capabilities of large language models and the reliance on smaller models in real-world deployments motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large models to smaller targets.

Method: The authors propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models, and then use the resulting transport plans to guide direct weight-space fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport enables effective knowledge transfer from large high-resource models to smaller low-resource targets, achieving consistent improvements over target models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an interactive framework for LLMs to generate and explain graph queries, improving accessibility to complex datasets while maintaining factual accuracy and semantic rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive domains, such as hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability, by leveraging the strengths of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Method: The authors introduce an interactive framework where LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries, and users refine them through natural language. The framework is applied to real-world KGs.

Result: The framework is evaluated using a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG, and two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI KG, demonstrating improved accessibility and factual accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed interactive framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor, and provides insight into model performance variation across domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm to improve large language models' performance across diverse tasks, achieving better worst-task accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of imbalanced outcomes in multi-task adaptation of GRPO and to improve reliable performance across diverse tasks.

Method: The authors propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that dynamically adapts task weights and introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights.

Result: Experiments show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy, achieving 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed MT-GRPO algorithm outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy and achieves improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new benchmark called CASTLE to evaluate the personalized safety of large language models (LLMs) in education, and demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying limitations in existing LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of existing safety evaluations for large language models (LLMs) in education, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes.

Method: The authors propose a new concept called Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct a benchmark called CASTLE based on educational theories. They design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, Emotional Empathy, and Student Alignment.

Result: Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge, with all models scoring below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that existing large language models (LLMs) have limitations in ensuring personalized safety in education, and proposes a new benchmark called CASTLE to address this issue.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

TL;DR: This study examines how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Hebrew, finding that tokenization strategies significantly impact their ability to capture morphological complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to understand how transformer models handle complex verb paradigms in morphologically rich languages like Turkish and Modern Hebrew, and how tokenization strategies affect this ability.

Method: The authors used the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data to investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, examining the impact of different tokenization strategies.

Result: The results show that for Turkish, both monolingual and multilingual models succeed regardless of tokenization strategy, while for Hebrew, monolingual and multilingual models diverge, with a morpheme-aware segmentation performing well in monolingual models.

Conclusion: The study concludes that transformer models' ability to represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew is influenced by tokenization strategies, with varying degrees of success across monolingual and multilingual models.

Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by making MedErrBench and evaluation protocols publicly available to advance multilingual clinical NLP and promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally.

Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally.

TL;DR: A novel neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-domain machine translation is proposed, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of domain adaptation in large language models (LLMs) for multi-domain machine translation, such as domain shift and parameter interference.

Method: The proposed method identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs by maximizing mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, and fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten translation domains show that the proposed method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework effectively mitigates parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting, enabling LLMs to capture generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances.

Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Jingze Shi,Zhangyang Peng,Yizhang Zhu,Yifan Wu,Guang Liu,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniMoE is a system-algorithm co-designed framework for fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts architectures, achieving high accuracy and low inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE designs face a trade-off between expert specialization granularity and hardware execution efficiency, motivating the need for a more efficient design.

Method: OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, a Cartesian Product Router, and Expert-Centric Scheduling to achieve scalable routing and execution.

Result: OmniMoE achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks and reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms compared to PEER.

Conclusion: OmniMoE demonstrates that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be both fast and accurate, outperforming coarse-grained and fine-grained baselines.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

*Hao Yang,Zhiyu Yang,Xupeng Zhang,Wei Wei,Yunjie Zhang,Lin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CompactRAG, a framework for multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning, achieving competitive accuracy while reducing token consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-hop RAG systems are inefficient due to repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops.

Method: The proposed CompactRAG framework involves an offline stage where an LLM converts the corpus into an atomic QA knowledge base, and an online stage where complex queries are decomposed, rewritten, and resolved through dense retrieval and RoBERTa-based answer extraction.

Result: Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines.

Conclusion: CompactRAG offers a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora, invoking the LLM only twice in total during inference, regardless of the number of reasoning hops.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.

TL;DR: LongR is a unified framework that enhances long-context performance in LLM reasoning by integrating a 'Think-and-Read' mechanism with a contextual density reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of long-context reasoning extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction, and existing efforts relying on sparse, outcome-only rewards yield limited gains.

Method: The authors propose LongR, a unified framework that integrates a dynamic 'Think-and-Read' mechanism with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain.

Result: LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, and consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms.

Conclusion: LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

TL;DR: This study investigates the bias against non-native speakers in detecting generated text using LLM-based detectors and finds no systematic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate the concerns about the misuse of LLM-based assistants in academia, particularly the potential bias against non-native speakers in detecting generated text.

Method: The authors examined detectors from three separate families and analyzed the perplexity of texts from native and non-native Czech speakers.

Result: The results show that the perplexity of texts from non-native Czech speakers is not lower than that of native speakers, and contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

Conclusion: The study found that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity and there is no systematic bias against non-native speakers in detecting generated text.

Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method for LLM-based agents to learn action-conditioned world models, and demonstrates its effectiveness on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in anticipating action consequences and adapting to environment dynamics in agentic settings, by introducing world-modeling capabilities.

Method: The proposed method, RWML, learns action-conditioned world models using sim-to-real gap rewards and aligns simulated next states with realized next states in a pre-trained embedding space.

Result: The results show significant gains over the base model on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench, and outperform direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points, respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that RWML provides a robust training signal and is effective in improving the performance of LLM-based agents in agentic settings, and has the potential to be combined with task-success rewards for further improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing evaluations that primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, neglecting the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously.

Method: The authors formalize and instantiate four primitives to translate abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments, establishing OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking and OdysseyArena-Challenge for stress-testing agent stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current LLMs have limitations in inductive scenarios, highlighting the need for further research to enable agentic foresight and sustain strategic coherence in complex environments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

TL;DR: RRAttention is a novel dynamic sparse attention method that achieves desirable properties through a head round-robin sampling strategy, reducing complexity and achieving significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts, and existing dynamic sparse attention methods face fundamental trade-offs.

Method: RRAttention employs a head round-robin (RR) sampling strategy, rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, and uses adaptive Top-τ selection for optimal sparsity.

Result: Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate the effectiveness of RRAttention.

Conclusion: RRAttention achieves over 99% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4× speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework for hate speech detection that improves cross-dataset robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection is a complex task with varying definitions across different frameworks and guidelines, leading to overfitting and limited robustness in supervised models.

Method: The proposed framework decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of concept-level questions answered by a large language model, and then aggregates the diagnostic signals using a lightweight decision tree.

Result: The results show that the framework improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift, and provides fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of faithfulness hallucinations in SRMs, particularly in intermediate CoT steps, which existing methods may not effectively mitigate.

Method: The proposed method, FaithRL, introduces step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards and an implicit truncated resampling strategy to generate contrastive signals from faithful prefixes.

Result: Experiments on multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks show that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

Conclusion: FaithRL is effective in improving the faithfulness of SRMs by reducing hallucinations in CoT reasoning, making it a promising approach for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KV-CoRE, an SVD-based method to quantify the compressibility of kv-caches in large language models, and analyzes compressibility patterns across models, datasets, and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are limited by kv-cache memory bandwidth, and existing compression methods neglect data-dependent nature of kv-caches.

Method: KV-CoRE uses SVD to compute optimal low-rank approximation under Frobenius norm, enabling efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation.

Result: The study reveals systematic patterns linking compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage, and shows that Normalized Effective Rank correlates with performance degradation under compression.

Conclusion: KV-CoRE establishes a principled evaluation framework and benchmark for kv-cache compressibility, offering insights for dynamic compression and data-centric model development.

Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the consistency of multilingual large language models in responding to value-laden multiple-choice questions across different languages, finding varying degrees of consistency and language-specific behavior in certain models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden multiple-choice question responses in multilingual large language models (LLMs), seeking to determine whether they behave like theoretical polyglots or a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values.

Method: The authors administered a subset of human-translated survey questions from the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS) corpus to over thirty multilingual large language models (LLMs) under controlled prompt variations, including answer order, symbol type, and tail character.

Result: The results show that larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, but their responses vary greatly across questions, with certain multiple-choice questions eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split.

Conclusion: The study found that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency in their responses to value-laden multiple-choice questions across languages, their robustness varies greatly across questions, and language-specific behavior arises in certain consistent models.

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long reasoning models struggle in multilingual settings due to limited abilities for multilingual question understanding and reasoning.

Method: TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training) framework, which integrates translation training into multilingual reasoning.

Result: Outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points on MMATH, improving answer correctness and language consistency.

Conclusion: Integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment and enhances translation quality for mathematical questions and general-domain text.

Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how humans traverse the geometry of semantic representations and retrieve meaning.

Method: The framework represents concept production as navigation through embedding space, using cumulative embeddings to construct participant-specific semantic trajectories and extract metrics such as distance, entropy, velocity, and acceleration.

Result: The approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types across different languages and tasks, and comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and artificial cognition assessment.

Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the limitations of the widely-used fixed, predefined block schedule in dLLMs, which is suboptimal for both quality and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method, and DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSB and DSB Cache consistently improve both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB) and DSB Cache methods improve generation quality and inference efficiency for diffusion large language models (dLLMs).

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.

Result: The results show that LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context, increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy, and ensembling supervised models with zero-shot LLMs achieves the best performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies in deploying LLMs for accurate mental health assessment, with findings indicating that detailed construct definitions, increased reasoning effort, and ensembling supervised models with zero-shot LLMs improve accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.

### [160] [Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06025)
*Haozhen Zhang,Haodong Yue,Tao Feng,Quanyu Long,Jianzhu Bao,Bowen Jin,Weizhi Zhang,Xiao Li,Jiaxuan You,Chengwei Qin,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which provides explicit control over performance-cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM systems rely on offline memory construction, which can be inefficient and discard query-critical information. Prior runtime memory utilization methods incur substantial overhead and offer limited control over performance-cost trade-offs.

Method: BudgetMem structures memory processing into modules with three budget tiers. A lightweight router uses a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning to balance task performance and memory construction cost.

Result: BudgetMem outperforms strong baselines when prioritizing performance and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA.

Conclusion: BudgetMem provides a unified testbed to study strategies for realizing budget tiers, clarifying the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies and their favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

Abstract: Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

### [161] [DFlash: Block Diffusion for Flash Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06036)
*Jian Chen,Yesheng Liang,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that uses a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting to accelerate autoregressive large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the high inference latency and poor GPU utilization in autoregressive large language models by enabling parallel generation.

Method: The method involves using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM, with the draft model being conditioned on context features extracted from the target model.

Result: Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

Conclusion: DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates, outperforming existing speculative decoding methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

### [162] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the linear model of AI progress and introduces 'familiar' and 'strange' intelligence concepts, arguing AI is likely 'strange intelligence' with superhuman and subhuman capacities. It defends a nonlinear model of intelligence and discusses implications for AI capacity evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional linear understanding of AI progress and propose a more nuanced view of intelligence.

Method: The paper introduces new concepts ('familiar' and 'strange' intelligence) and develops a nonlinear model of intelligence, defending it against the traditional linear model.

Result: The analysis supports the notion that AI intelligence is likely 'strange', combining superhuman and subhuman capacities, and that a nonlinear model of intelligence is more appropriate.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that if AI is 'strange intelligence', even capable systems may fail in obvious tasks, and performance in one task domain does not imply broad capacities.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

### [163] [DeepRead: Document Structure-Aware Reasoning to Enhance Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05014)
*Zhanli Li,Huiwen Tian,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent for long-document question answering, leveraging document-native priors and achieving significant improvements over existing agentic search frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic search frameworks underutilize document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure when treating long documents as flat collections of chunks.

Method: DeepRead converts PDFs into structured Markdown, indexes documents at the paragraph level with coordinate-style metadata, and equips the LLM with Retrieve and ReadSection tools for localized and order-preserving reading.

Result: DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering, validating the synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DeepRead in long-document question answering, revealing a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like 'locate then read' behavior.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

### [164] [MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048)
*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to optimize AI agent's elicitation strategies for joint planning with humans in object-driven planning problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address knowledge gaps in joint planning between humans and AI agents, particularly in open-world planning problems with incomplete information and unknowns.

Method: The authors propose MINT, a neuro-symbolic approach that builds a symbolic tree to reason about knowledge gaps and leverages self-play to optimize AI agent's elicitation strategies. They also use LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process to curate queries for human input elicitation.

Result: The evaluation on three benchmarks shows that MINT-based planning achieves near-expert returns, improved rewards, and success rates by issuing a limited number of questions per task.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MINT is an effective approach for optimizing AI agent's elicitation strategies in joint planning with humans, particularly in object-driven planning problems with knowledge gaps.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

*Adithya Kulkarni,Mohna Chakraborty,Jay Bagga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines the performance of a Large Language Model (LLM) on graph theoretic problems, finding that it supports exploration of established material but is limited in tasks requiring novel insight or critical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reliably LLMs support mathematically rigorous thinking as they become integrated into computer science coursework.

Method: An eight-stage evaluation protocol reflecting authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction, was used to assess the LLM's performance on a solved and an open graph theoretic problem.

Result: The LLM performed strongly on the solved problem, producing a valid proof, but did not advance toward a solution for the open problem, instead acknowledging uncertainty.

Conclusion: LLMs can support exploration of established material but are limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning, highlighting the need to guide students in using LLMs effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework for uncertainty quantification in large language models for interactive agents, highlighting the importance of interactivity in actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to shift UQ research from single-turn question-answering to realistic settings with interactive agents, as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in complex tasks.

Method: The paper presents a general formulation of agent UQ, analyzes prior works, and proposes a new perspective on conditional uncertainty reduction.

Result: The paper shows that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, which breaks down for interactive agents, and proposes a conditional uncertainty reduction process that models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a novel perspective on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) in interactive agent settings, and outlines a conceptual framework for designing UQ in LLM agent setups, with practical implications for frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

### [167] [Optimizing Mission Planning for Multi-Debris Rendezvous Using Reinforcement Learning with Refueling and Adaptive Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05075)
*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Gunther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes a reinforcement learning framework for adaptive collision avoidance in active debris removal missions using small satellites, demonstrating improved mission efficiency and reduced collision risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing crowding of Earth's orbital environment with debris poses significant challenges for active debris removal missions, necessitating the development of adaptive collision avoidance strategies.

Method: The proposed framework integrates refueling strategies, mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance using a masked Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling dynamic adjustments to maneuvers based on real-time orbital conditions.

Result: Simulations using the Iridium 33 debris dataset show that the reinforcement learning framework reduces collision risk and improves mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning framework provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris removal missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

TL;DR: This study validates the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in mental health by comparing clinician and LLM judge ratings of simulated chatbot conversations, showing strong alignment and clinical validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI chatbots for mental health support raises concerns about their safety, particularly in detecting and responding to suicide risk.

Method: The study simulated conversations between LLM-based user-agents and AI chatbots, which were then rated by clinicians and an LLM judge using a scoring rubric. The ratings were compared to assess the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation.

Result: The study found strong alignment between clinician consensus and the LLM judge's ratings, establishing the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation. Clinicians also perceived the user-agents to be realistic.

Conclusion: The findings support the use of VERA-MH as an open-source, automated AI safety evaluation for mental health, with potential for realizing the mental health benefits of AI chatbots while prioritizing safety.

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

TL;DR: This paper compares three planners for Active Debris Removal (ADR) mission planning in Low Earth Orbit, evaluating their performance under different mission constraints and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance efficiency, adaptability, and feasibility constraints in ADR mission planning motivates this work, which aims to compare different planning approaches.

Method: The paper compares a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with 300 test cases across various scenarios.

Result: Results show that nominal PPO performs well under matched training conditions but degrades under distributional shift, domain-randomized PPO is more adaptable with moderate nominal performance loss, and MCTS handles constraint changes best but with high computation time.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, suggesting that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible for real-world applications of intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination.

Method: Designing and developing GAMMS, a graph-based simulation framework that supports fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in graph-representable environments.

Result: GAMMS enables efficient simulation of complex domains, supports various agent types, and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration, facilitating experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: GAMMS lowers the barrier to entry for researchers, enables high-performance simulations on standard hardware, and facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling. The framework is open-source and available at https://github.com/GAMMSim/GAMMS/

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured multi-evaluator framework to assess LLM reasoning in merchant risk assessment and evaluates its effectiveness using five frontier LLMs and payment-industry experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood.

Method: A structured multi-evaluator framework is introduced, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions.

Result: Results reveal substantial heterogeneity in LLM self-evaluation bias and cross-model deviation. Evaluation by payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data confirms that four models exhibit statistically significant alignment with genuine quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

### [172] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Democratic Preference Optimization (DemPO), a framework for fine-tuning AI systems using algorithmic sortition to ensure demographic representativeness in human raters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of biased human rater pools in preference-based alignment methods like RLHF, which can lead to AI systems that do not reflect the values of diverse demographics.

Method: The authors propose two training schemes: Hard Panel, which trains exclusively on preferences from a quota-satisfying mini-public sampled via sortition, and Soft Panel, which retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery.

Result: The results show that the Hard Panel consistently ranks first, and the Soft Panel outperforms the unweighted baseline across six aggregation methods, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics, and that DemPO is an effective framework for achieving this.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

*Keyang Xuan,Pengda Wang,Chongrui Ye,Haofei Yu,Tal August,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SocialVeil, a social learning environment that simulates social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers, and evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in such settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in interactive environments assume idealized communication, limiting the ability to diagnose their performance in realistic, imperfect settings.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction and introduced three representative types of disruption: semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, and emotional interference. They also proposed two barrier-aware evaluation metrics: unresolved confusion and mutual understanding.

Result: Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs showed that communication barriers consistently impaired performance, reducing mutual understanding by over 45% and elevating confusion by nearly 50%. Human evaluations validated the fidelity of the simulated barriers.

Conclusion: This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, enabling the exploration of the social intelligence of LLM agents. The results highlight the limitations of current LLMs in handling imperfect communication and the need for further research on adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings, where existing methods fail to capture traffic's chaotic nature.

Method: The method involves employing a chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, and utilizing innovations like chaos-aware attention, adaptive topology learning, and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment.

Result: The results show that CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while providing interpretable regime analysis and horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that CAST-CKT is an effective framework for traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings, with improved generalisation bounds and extensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods often rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are limited to local or single-document contexts and suffer from information isolation.

Method: HugRAG rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules, explicitly modeling causal relationships to enable scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: HugRAG establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes two methods, DAKS and alignment graph, to improve retrieval-augmented generation in the domain of Chinese Tibetan medicine with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of retrieval-augmented generation in a domain with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases, where dense encyclopedia entries can dominate retrieval, and authoritative evidence from classics or clinical papers is not prioritized.

Method: The authors propose two complementary methods: DAKS for KB routing and budgeted retrieval, and an alignment graph for guiding evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing.

Result: Experiments show that the full system achieves the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness, with consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification in retrieval-augmented generation for Chinese Tibetan medicine.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

*Guozhi Liu,Weiwei Lin,Tiansheng Huang,Ruichao Mo,Qi Mu,Xiumin Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called Surgery to mitigate the safety risks of large language models caused by harmful fine-tuning, utilizing the attention sink mechanism and sink divergence suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the safety risks exposed by harmful fine-tuning of large language models, which can invalidate their safety alignment.

Method: The method involves measuring sink divergence for each attention head, proposing a separable sink divergence hypothesis, and using a regularizer for sink divergence suppression to steer attention heads towards the negative sink divergence group.

Result: The results show that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90%, 11.25%, and 9.55% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed Surgery method is effective in mitigating the safety risks of large language models caused by harmful fine-tuning.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

*Xinyi He,Ying Yang,Chuanjian Fu,Sihan Guo,Songchun Zhu,Lifeng Fan,Zhenliang Zhang,Yujia Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic in-situ task generation method for evaluating general intelligent agents in unseen 3D environments, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks suffer from data contamination and lack scene specificity, making it inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings.

Method: The authors define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA), comprising an interaction stage and an evolution stage.

Result: Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans revealed significant performance gaps.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments, showing that current models perform poorly on basic perception tasks and lack 3D interaction awareness.

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces recos, a new similarity metric that outperforms traditional cosine similarity in capturing semantic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional cosine similarity metric is limited to capturing linear relationships due to its basis in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, failing to model complex, nonlinear structures in real-world semantic spaces.

Method: The authors derive a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound, leading to the development of recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by sorted vector components.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative to traditional cosine similarity, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for using LLMs in security management, addressing unreliability and hallucination challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reliability of LLMs in security management tasks, such as incident response planning, by addressing their tendency to hallucinate and be unreliable.

Method: The method involves integrating LLMs in an iterative loop that generates candidate actions, checks for consistency, and refines actions through in-context learning based on external feedback.

Result: The framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% in incident response planning compared to frontier LLMs, as shown in experiments on four public datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed framework can control hallucination risk and improve the performance of LLMs in security management tasks by tuning the consistency threshold and using in-context learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

*Xilin Dai,Wanxu Cai,Zhijian Xu,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that universal foundation models for time series are flawed due to category error and proposes a Causal Control Agent paradigm instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of universal foundation models for time series being ineffective due to the diverse generative processes of time series data.

Method: The paper introduces the 'Autoregressive Blindness Bound' to prove the limitation of history-only models and advocates for a Causal Control Agent paradigm.

Result: The result is a theoretical limit that shows history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts, and a proposed paradigm shift towards robust, control-theoretic systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that benchmarks should shift from 'Zero-Shot Accuracy' to 'Drift Adaptation Speed' to prioritize robust systems.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes AMR, a novel framework for MOOC recommendation that models path-specific multiple aspects and automatically discovers metapaths, outperforming state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOOC recommendation methods suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization, while existing graph-based approaches rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which are limited and costly.

Method: The proposed AMR framework models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath, automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, and incorporates aspect-aware path representations as edge features in subgraphs.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics, and effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information.

Conclusion: AMR is a novel and effective framework for MOOC recommendation that overcomes the limitations of traditional methods and existing graph-based approaches, providing more accurate recommendations.

Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' negotiation ability using PieArena, a benchmark based on MBA negotiation scenarios, and finds that frontier LMs match or outperform business-school students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to negotiate, a key business task requiring strategic reasoning and economic value creation.

Method: Introduced PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark based on realistic MBA negotiation scenarios, to evaluate LLMs' negotiation capabilities.

Result: Frontier LMs, such as GPT-5, match or outperform trained business-school students in negotiation tasks, with asymmetric gains from joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding.

Conclusion: Frontier language agents are capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with long-horizon planning due to compounding errors in simulating future states.

Method: ProAct uses a two-stage training paradigm: Grounded LookAhead Distillation for supervised fine-tuning on search-derived trajectories, and Monte-Carlo Critic for refining decision accuracy with a low-variance signal.

Result: ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy in stochastic and deterministic environments, with a 4B parameter model outperforming open-source baselines and rivaling closed-source models.

Conclusion: ProAct enables LLM agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning, demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

Method: The paper proposes AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem, utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search with Red-Black Pruning to navigate the search space.

Result: Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR) and proposing AgentXRay, a search-based framework that synthesizes interpretable workflows for black-box agentic systems, achieving higher proxy similarity and reduced token consumption.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

Conclusion: Current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaBiT is a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation in residual binarization, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significant inference speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of pathological feature co-adaptation in residual binarization, which limits the expressive capacity of the model. They identify inter-path adaptation as a key failure mode during quantization-aware training (QAT).

Method: The authors propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, ensuring that every path corrects the error of the preceding one.

Result: RaBiT achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers a significant inference speed-up over full-precision models.

Conclusion: RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier, achieving state-of-the-art performance, rivalling hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivering a 4.49× inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

TL;DR: This study evaluated four small medical LLMs on answering ophthalmology-related patient queries, finding Meerkat-7B to perform best and MedLLaMA3-v20 to perform poorest, with GPT-4-Turbo showing strong alignment with clinician assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the safety and accuracy of domain-specific large language models in ophthalmology, particularly for patient education, triage, and clinical decision-making.

Method: A cross-sectional study where 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by four small medical LLMs (Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20), generating 2160 responses. These responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists and GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework.

Result: Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents.

GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall.

Conclusion: Medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question-answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus. The study supported the feasibility of LLM-based evaluation for large-scale benchmarking and highlighted the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a physics-informed neural framework, OPINN, for opinion dynamics modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to effectively model opinion dynamics to mitigate polarization and secure cyberspace, and the limitations of existing methods that are tailored to incomplete priors and struggle to deeply encode physical priors.

Method: The authors propose a neural opinion dynamics framework based on Neural ODEs and a Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory, and develop the OPINN framework.

Result: The OPINN framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the OPINN framework offers a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems, and is effective in modeling opinion dynamics.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in capturing the complexity of real administrative workflows in hospitals, as prior work has focused on isolated tasks or patient-physician interactions.

Method: The method involves creating a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework, H-AdminSim, that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation and FHIR integration for interoperability.

Result: The result is a standardized testbed, H-AdminSim, that enables systematic comparison of LLMs and assesses the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that H-AdminSim provides a unified environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, driving the assessment of LLM-based automation in hospital administration.

Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

### [193] [THOR: Inductive Link Prediction over Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05424)
*Weijian Yu,Yuhuan Lu,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes THOR, an inductive link prediction technique for hyper-relational knowledge graphs, which outperforms existing baselines in link prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing link prediction techniques for hyper-relational knowledge graphs are mostly transductive, limiting their generalizability to new vocabularies. This paper aims to address this limitation by proposing an inductive link prediction technique.

Method: The authors introduce relation and entity foundation graphs to model interactions in hyper-relational knowledge graphs. They then design THOR, which learns from these foundation graphs using parallel graph encoders and a transformer decoder, supporting efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference.

Result: THOR outperforms existing baselines in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets, yielding significant improvements over rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed THOR technique demonstrates superior performance in link prediction tasks for hyper-relational knowledge graphs, and the ablation studies reveal key design factors that capture structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using the mined data achieved state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed M$^2$-Miner framework effectively addresses the challenges of GUI agent data annotation, enabling the construction of powerful GUI agents with improved performance.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electricity price forecasting is challenging due to the volatility and nonlinearity of price signals, and traditional models struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data.

Method: The paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates various TSFMs (e.g. TTMs, MOIRAI, MOMENT, TimesFM) against traditional statistical and DL models (e.g. ARIMA, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data from Singapore, incorporating exogenous factors where applicable.

Result: TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing conditional representation learning methods, including sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference.

Method: The proposed OD-CRL framework incorporates Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with curvature-based truncation, while NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces.

Result: Extensive experiments across customized clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

Conclusion: The OD-CRL framework effectively addresses the challenges in conditional representation learning, providing a robust and efficient solution for customized tasks.

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces.

TL;DR: ALIVE is a hands-free alignment framework that internalizes reasoning principles through adversarial learning and instructive verbal feedback, achieving significant improvements in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) is limited by scalar rewards that are costly, brittle, and blind to the underlying logic of a solution, hindering expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models.

Method: ALIVE uses adversarial learning with instructive verbal evaluation, unifying problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations, achieving accuracy gains, improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ALIVE achieves accuracy gains, improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates, indicating a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human supervision.

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Phi-former, a hierarchical interaction representation learning method for predicting compound-protein interactions, achieving superior performance and providing interpretable insights for rational drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent deep learning methods for predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) do not always align with chemical realities as they model CPIs at the atomic level, whereas molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) are the primary units of biological recognition and binding.

Method: Phi-former is a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that Phi-former accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations.

Conclusion: Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks and provides interpretable model explanations, guiding rational drug design and supporting precision medicine applications.

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to reduce latency in large language models (LLMs) used in interactive multimedia applications, as their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency.

Method: The authors propose SDFP, a framework that builds a draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM, removing low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model.

Result: SDFP achieves 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SDFP is a viable solution for reducing latency in LLMs, enabling rapid and deployment-friendly draft construction without requiring additional training or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources for AI-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology lack high-quality, structured datasets, particularly for ameloblastoma.

Method: The dataset was curated by integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data from case reports. Natural language processing and image preprocessing techniques were employed.

Result: The developed multimodal deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 65.9% in variant classification and an F1-score of 90.3% in abnormal tissue detection, showing substantial improvements.

Conclusion: This work advances patient-specific decision support by providing a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework for ameloblastoma diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Split Personality Training (SPT) to detect misalignment in large language models by fine-tuning a second 'honest persona' to review the main model's responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training, and standard auditing techniques are insufficient.

Method: The authors introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second 'honest persona' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation and are activated to review the main model's responses.

Result: SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy in detecting misalignment on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism benchmark, whereas the baseline method reports near 0% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed SPT method is effective in detecting misalignment in large language models by revealing latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

Method: The authors develop a framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation, and quadratic variation process, introducing an explicit drift correction to a pretrained diffusion model.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate effectiveness in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples, with non-asymptotic guarantees provided for the conditional sampler.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework that ensures constraint satisfaction with probability one, with numerical experiments validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

*Fahad Anwaar,Adil Mehmood Khan,Muhammad Khalid,Usman Zia,Kezhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework, RGCF-XRec, is presented for explainable sequential recommendations by integrating collaborative filtering knowledge into a language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for explainable recommendation systems either overlook collaborative signals or treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in inefficiencies.

Method: RGCF-XRec introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering knowledge into a language model, uses a scoring mechanism to filter high-quality explanations, and employs a unified representation learning network.

Result: RGCF-XRec demonstrates improvements across various Amazon datasets, enhancing HR@10, ROUGE-L, and reducing the cold-warm performance gap, while achieving training efficiency with a lightweight backbone.

Conclusion: RGCF-XRec offers a robust and efficient solution for explainable sequential recommendations, showing significant gains in performance and generalization across different datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents a test-time self-refinement framework for enhancing geometric reasoning in VLMs, inspired by human cognitive processes, and achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in continuous geometric reasoning tasks, such as Tangram puzzle assembly, and aims to improve their performance through human-inspired mechanisms.

Method: The authors design a framework that models human cognitive mechanisms for solving Tangram puzzles and introduce a test-time self-refinement framework combining in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops.

Result: The proposed verifier-refiner agent achieves IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining, demonstrating the effectiveness of the introduced framework.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a test-time self-refinement framework that enhances geometric reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms, achieving significant improvements in IoU without model retraining.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict individual-level biases and emulate biased human behavior under different contextual factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand if LLMs can reproduce human biases at the individual level and simulate biased human behavior when contextual factors interact with these biases.

Method: The authors conducted a human experiment with 1100 participants who engaged with a chatbot to make decisions. They then used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate the same conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5.

Result: The results showed that LLMs can reproduce human biases with precision. Notable differences were found between models in how they aligned with human behavior.

Conclusion: The study has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of developing effective NLP systems for low-resource languages by leveraging cross-lingual knowledge transfer from high-resource languages.

Method: The authors introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation), and compare it with two baselines: augmentation in hidden layers and token embedding transfer through token translation.

Result: Experimental results show that the GNN-based GETR approach achieves 13 percentage point improvements on POS tagging for truly low-resource languages and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages across sentiment classification and NER tasks, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed GETR method significantly outperforms existing baselines in cross-lingual knowledge transfer for low-resource languages, achieving notable improvements in POS tagging, sentiment classification, and NER tasks.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Resin, a probabilistic programming language, and Reactive Circuits (RCs), a meta-structure for efficient and exact probabilistic reasoning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of exact inference in complex probabilistic models incurring prohibitive computational costs, particularly for autonomous agents in dynamic environments.

Method: The authors propose Resin and RCs, leveraging reactive programming and asynchronous data streams to achieve efficient and exact probabilistic reasoning.

Result: The approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference in high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning.

Conclusion: By using Resin and RCs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems, reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts and enabling efficient real-time belief updates.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

*Benny Cheung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Ontology, a framework combining traditional ontologies and large language models to generate novel artifacts with structural validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional ontologies and large language models. Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts, while large language models generate fluently but lack structural validity.

Method: The authors propose a framework that encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas to constrain LLM generation. A multi-agent pipeline is used to assign specialized roles to different ontology domains.

Result: The framework is demonstrated through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. The outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining creative.

Conclusion: The authors argue that constraints enable creativity, just as grammar makes poetry possible, and ontology makes structured generation possible. The pattern generalizes beyond games to other domains with expert vocabulary and validity constraints.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Result: The survey identifies critical challenges and future research directions in graph-based agent memory and collects related resources for the community.

Conclusion: The survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the energy footprint of LLMs, as existing approaches oversimplify energy consumption estimation.

Method: Deriving an analytical model from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, and evaluating energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs.

Result: The proposed model accurately characterizes the energy efficiency curve, showing that efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, and achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%.

Conclusion: Aligning sequence lengths with 'Sweet Spots' can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation, achieving higher parameter efficiency and superior fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors found that basis vectors in standard LoRA exhibit significant parameter redundancy, motivating the development of GenLoRA.

Method: GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize basis vectors.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: GenLoRA achieves higher parameter efficiency and superior fine-tuning performance compared to standard LoRA.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: This paper identifies a pathology in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) called Recursive Space Contraction (RSC) and proposes Anchored Policy Optimization (APO) to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the Recursive Space Contraction (RSC) pathology in RLVR, which leads to an irreversible collapse of valid alternatives.

Method: The method involves proposing Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), which shifts the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage by defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support.

Result: The result is that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches, thus addressing the RSC pathology.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV) to mitigate hallucinations in financial RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations in model-generated responses that contradict retrieved documents in financial RAG systems.

Method: Decomposed financial responses into atomic knowledge units, assessed their correctness, and computed fine-grained faithful rewards. Incorporated an informativeness reward to prevent overly concise replies.

Result: Experiments on the FDD task and FDD-ANT dataset demonstrated consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of the RLFKV approach.

Conclusion: The proposed RLFKV framework improves the alignment of model-generated responses with retrieved documents, enhancing the reliability of financial RAG systems.

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks rely on static indicators and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models. The authors aim to improve the detection of membership inference by actively probing the model's internal representations.

Method: The authors propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector.

Result: LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures, raising AUC from near-chance levels to 0.81-0.88 and increasing TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: LeakBoost offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference. The authors provide a detailed sensitivity analysis to identify the strongest leakage and improvements in gradient-based detectors.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations in existing synchronous execution-based reinforcement learning frameworks for VLA models.

Method: The proposed method involves a multi-level decoupled architecture with asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates.

Result: The results show that the proposed framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25% on the LIBERO benchmark compared to existing synchronous strategies, and up to 126.67% when deeply optimizing separation strategies. The effectiveness of each asynchronous component is verified via ablation studies, and the method demonstrates excellent scalability across 8 to 256 GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed fully-asynchronous policy training framework is effective in improving the training efficiency of VLA models, achieving significant throughput improvements and demonstrating excellent scalability.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems. We develop two model variants: FiMI Base and FiMI Instruct. FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data. This is followed by instruction fine-tuning and domain-specific supervised fine-tuning focused on multi-turn, tool-driven conversations that model real-world workflows, such as transaction disputes and mandate lifecycle management. Evaluations reveal that FiMI Base achieves a 20% improvement over the Mistral Small 24B Base model on finance reasoning benchmark, while FiMI Instruct outperforms the Mistral Small 24B Instruct model by 87% on domain-specific tool-calling. Moreover, FiMI achieves these significant domain gains while maintaining comparable performance to models of similar size on general benchmarks.

*Kang Chen,Zhuoka Feng,Sihan Zhao,Kai Xiong,Junjie Nian,Yaoning Wang,Changyi Xiao,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework, effectively ranks candidate responses and merged variants in large language models, predicting downstream accuracy and identifying better variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models shift the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution, motivating the need for an unsupervised scoring framework to rank candidate responses and merged variants.

Method: The NEX framework views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation), using entropy-based exploration proxies and sparse activation caches to detect E-phase and infer E-X phases.

Result: NEX successfully predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, with validation through human annotations and causal evidence via neuron transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed NEX framework effectively ranks candidate responses and merged variants without task answers, predicting downstream accuracy and identifying better variants across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.

This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker effectively addresses the limitations of current prompting strategies for LLMs in TKGQA, achieving state-of-the-art performance through its autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to alleviate the manual and suboptimal process of seating allocation for large organizations with hierarchical teams, ensuring teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity.

Method: The method involves calculating the distance between seats using PRM and RRT, and then solving the HSAP using integer programming combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming.

Result: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different sized instances, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a scalable and efficient solution to the HSAP, improving upon the current manual and suboptimal seating allocation process.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLM-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges, and existing AI security frameworks lack a rigorous 'separation of concerns' standard.

Method: The authors propose a threat modeling framework that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis, introducing a human-centric asset taxonomy and a formal graph-based model.

Result: The framework's practical applicability is demonstrated through an open-source attack path suggestion tool called AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator.

Conclusion: The proposed AgentHeLLM framework addresses the methodological gap in existing AI security frameworks, enhancing the security of LLM-based conversational agents in vehicles.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

Conclusion: This paper aims to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows, emphasizing principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation to help modelers make informed decisions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Result: Quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across routing distance, compactness, and route overlap.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems like CVRP.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting (GATTF) model to improve motorway traffic forecasting by incorporating geographical relationships between sensors using mutual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management relies on high-resolution real-time traffic data and predicted traffic conditions. However, predicting motorway traffic is challenging due to its spatio-temporal complexity and non-linear nature.

Method: The GATTF model was developed using sequence-based deep-learning techniques and evaluated with real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland.

Result: Incorporating geographical awareness through mutual information enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer without increasing model complexity.

Conclusion: The GATTF model improves motorway traffic forecasting by leveraging geographical relationships between distributed sensors, thus enhancing the accuracy of traffic predictions.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features.

Conclusion: The paper introduces AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents, and benchmarks state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing gaps in negotiation performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of assessing new interventions in virtual reality, which requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult.

Method: The authors develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies.

Result: The simulator is shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, enabling scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns, which are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem-solving.

Method: DyTopo embeds lightweight natural-language query and key descriptors from each agent and performs semantic matching to route private messages along induced edges.

Result: DyTopo consistently outperforms the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2) across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones.

Conclusion: DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.

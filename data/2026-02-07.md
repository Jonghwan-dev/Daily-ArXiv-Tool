### [1] [SIDeR: Semantic Identity Decoupling for Unrestricted Face Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04994)
*Zhuosen Bao,Xia Du,Zheng Lin,Jizhe Zhou,Zihan Fang,Jiening Wu,Yuxin Zhang,Zhe Chen,Chi-man Pun,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SIDeR, a framework for face privacy protection that decouples identity information from visual representations, generating anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deep integration of facial recognition into online services has raised concerns about privacy protection, and the need to decouple identity information from visual representations has become a critical challenge.

Method: SIDeR decomposes facial images into identity feature vectors and semantic appearance components, leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in a diffusion model's latent space to generate anonymous adversarial faces.

Result: Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.

Conclusion: The proposed SIDeR framework effectively protects face privacy while maintaining machine-level identity consistency, with the added feature of authorized access to restore the original image with a correct password.

Abstract: With the deep integration of facial recognition into online banking, identity verification, and other networked services, achieving effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations during image storage and transmission has become a critical challenge for privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve multi-object tracking performance by directly optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning, unlike prior methods that redesign tracking architectures.

Method: UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems.

Result: Extensive evaluations show up to 53% reduction in identity switches and 12% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7% MOTA on SportsMOT.

Conclusion: UniTrack consistently improves multi-object tracking performance across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and universality.

Abstract: We present UniTrack, a plug-and-play graph-theoretic loss function designed to significantly enhance multi-object tracking (MOT) performance by directly optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning. Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.

### [3] [VISTA: Enhancing Visual Conditioning via Track-Following Preference Optimization in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05049)
*Yiye Chen,Yanan Jian,Xiaoyi Dong,Shuxin Cao,Jing Wu,Patricio Vela,Benjamin E. Lundell,Dongdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training framework to strengthen visual conditioning in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, improving their task performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the issue of vision-action misalignment in VLA models, where action predictions weakly depend on the current visual state, leading to unreliable outputs.

Method: The proposed approach involves two steps: 1) aligning action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and 2) transferring the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning.

Result: The method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA and yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that strengthening visual conditioning in VLA models through the proposed training framework can improve their reliability and task performance without requiring architectural modifications or additional data collection.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

### [4] [Food Portion Estimation: From Pixels to Calories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05078)
*Gautham Vinod,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores different strategies for accurate portion estimation in image-based dietary assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based dietary assessment is crucial for monitoring health and preventing chronic diseases, but it faces challenges in estimating food size from 2D images.

Method: The paper reviews various strategies, including the use of auxiliary inputs and deep learning approaches, for portion estimation.

Result: The paper explores different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation, but does not provide a specific result.

Conclusion: The paper likely concludes by highlighting the effectiveness of various strategies for portion estimation in image-based dietary assessment.

Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to ensure the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare by identifying model shortcomings through auditing methods.

Method: The authors used Visual Concept Ranking (VCR) to generate hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies within LMMs, and validated these hypotheses with manual interventions.

Result: The results showed that LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, and VCR was able to uncover visual feature dependencies within these models.

Conclusion: The authors introduced a method called Visual Concept Ranking (VCR) to identify important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and applied it to investigate model behaviors in medical tasks, revealing performance gaps between demographic subgroups.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.

### [6] [CLEAR-HPV: Interpretable Concept Discovery for HPV-Associated Morphology in Whole-Slide Histology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05126)
*Weiyi Qin,Yingci Liu-Swetz,Shiwei Tan,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLEAR-HPV, a framework for concept-level explainable attention-guided representation for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, providing morphologic interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) in providing limited morphologic interpretability for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology.

Method: CLEAR-HPV restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training.

Result: CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector, preserving predictive information while reducing high-dimensional feature space.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HPV provides compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology, generalizing consistently across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.

### [7] [ARGaze: Autoregressive Transformers for Online Egocentric Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05132)
*Jia Li,Wenjie Zhao,Shijian Deng,Bolin Lai,Yuheng Wu,RUijia Chen,Jon E. Froehlich,Yuhang Zhao,Yapeng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ARGaze, a model for online egocentric gaze estimation that predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using past and current frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of online egocentric gaze estimation is essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies, but it lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from indirect cues.

Method: ARGaze reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction using a transformer decoder that conditions on current visual features and a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates.

Result: The proposed ARGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction, and the authors will release their source code and pre-trained models.

Abstract: Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction. We will release our source code and pre-trained models.

### [8] [AirGlove: Exploring Egocentric 3D Hand Tracking and Appearance Generalization for Sensing Gloves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05159)
*Wenhui Cui,Ziyi Kou,Chuan Qin,Ergys Ristani,Li Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands and proposes AirGlove to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the limitations of sensor-based tracking and the need to improve vision-based hand tracking models for gloved hands.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under zero-shot and fine-tuning setups, and propose AirGlove to generalize learned glove representations to new gloves.

Result: The results show that existing bare-hand models suffer from performance degradation on sensing gloves, but AirGlove achieves a significant performance boost on new glove designs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AirGlove effectively generalizes hand pose models to new glove designs, improving performance on gloved hands.

Abstract: Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.

### [9] [SHaSaM: Submodular Hard Sample Mining for Fair Facial Attribute Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05162)
*Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SHaSaM, a novel combinatorial approach to address fairness issues in deep neural networks by modeling fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes.

Method: The proposed two-stage approach, SHaSaM, comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which uses submodular subset selection to mine hard positives and negatives, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes.

Result: Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The unified formulation of SHaSaM restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data during model training, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes like race, age, gender etc. Existing methods fall prey to the inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize on sensitive attributes, worsening unfairness and performance. To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater photography is plagued by reduced contrast, spatial blur, and color distortions, making it necessary to develop a correction method.

Method: A synthetic corruption pipeline is introduced, and a diffusion-based generation model is trained to reverse its effects.

Result: The proposed methodology achieves high perceptual consistency and strong generalization in synthesizing 512x768 images.

Conclusion: The developed image-to-image pipeline effectively corrects underwater photography distortions, achieving high-quality results.

Abstract: Underwater photography presents significant inherent challenges including reduced contrast, spatial blur, and wavelength-dependent color distortions. These effects can obscure the vibrancy of marine life and awareness photographers in particular are often challenged with heavy post-processing pipelines to correct for these distortions.
  We develop an image-to-image pipeline that learns to reverse underwater degradations by introducing a synthetic corruption pipeline and learning to reverse its effects with diffusion-based generation. Training and evaluation are performed on a small high-quality dataset of awareness photography images by Keith Ellenbogen. The proposed methodology achieves high perceptual consistency and strong generalization in synthesizing 512x768 images using a model of ~11M parameters after training from scratch on ~2.5k images.

### [11] [ShapePuri: Shape Guided and Appearance Generalized Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05175)
*Zhe Li,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in visual recognition, but they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that is imperceptible to the human. Although existing defense strategies such as adversarial training and purification have achieved progress, diffusion-based purification often involves high computational costs and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce Shape Guided Purification (ShapePuri), a novel defense framework enhances robustness by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants. ShapePuri integrates two components: a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance through Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias via stochastic transformations. In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.

### [12] [PoseGaussian: Pose-Driven Novel View Synthesis for Robust 3D Human Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05190)
*Ju Shen,Chen Chen,Tam V. Nguyen,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis, achieving real-time rendering at 100 FPS and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion, by utilizing human body pose as a structural prior and temporal cue.

Method: The method involves fusing pose with a color encoder to refine depth estimation and processing pose with a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency, integrated into an end-to-end trainable pipeline.

Result: The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy, with PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, and LPIPS 0.028 on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed PoseGaussian framework achieves high-fidelity human novel view synthesis, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines and enabling real-time rendering at 100 FPS.

Abstract: We propose PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis. Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines. We validate our approach on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028).

### [13] [GT-SVJ: Generative-Transformer-Based Self-Supervised Video Judge For Efficient Video Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05202)
*Shivanshu Shekhar,Uttaran Bhattacharya,Raghavendra Addanki,Mehrab Tanjim,Somdeb Sarkhel,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to aligning video generative models with human preferences by repurposing video generative models as reward models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics, motivating the need for a new approach.

Method: The authors present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge, transforming state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models by reformulating them as energy-based models (EBMs) trained via contrastive objectives, and designing challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations, significantly fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that repurposing video generative models as reward models is a promising approach for aligning video generative models with human preferences, and demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through experimental results.

Abstract: Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

*Chuqin Zhou,Xiaoyue Ling,Yunuo Chen,Jincheng Dai,Guo Lu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for generative compression that integrates explicit and implicit representations to achieve state-of-the-art rate-perception performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative compression methods are constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. The authors aim to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics and employ reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. A plug-in encoder is introduced to control the distortion-perception tradeoff.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively integrates explicit and implicit representations, achieving superior rate-perception performance and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.

*Jiahao Nie,Wenbin An,Gongjie Zhang,Yicheng Xu,Yap-Peng Tan,Alex C. Kot,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for Temporal Video Grounding that improves event perception and localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Temporal Video Grounding fail to capture semantic continuity and integrity of events, leading to ambiguities.

Method: E.M.Ground introduces a special <event> token, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, and multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance event matching and temporal understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.

Conclusion: E.M.Ground improves Temporal Video Grounding by focusing on holistic and coherent event perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which aims to precisely localize time segments corresponding to query events, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multi-view Progressive Adaptation to improve Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation by progressively adapting few-shot capability to target domains through data and strategy perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation still exhibit constrained performance due to limited quantity and diversity of target samples, and the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains.

Method: The authors propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which includes Hybrid Progressive Augmentation and Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction to progressively adapt few-shot capability to target domains.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-view Progressive Adaptation (MPA) effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

TL;DR: The paper proposes Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of SAM in promptable segmentation motivated the development of training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, but existing SAM-based methods perform poorly in CD-FSS due to large domain shifts.

Method: The proposed CPS approach adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars by leveraging ground-truth masks to sparsify dense matched points.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CPS is an effective training-free approach for CD-FSS, addressing the challenge of large domain shifts and improving segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Motivated by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in promptable segmentation, recent studies leverage SAM to develop training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, which aims to predict object masks in the target image based on a few reference exemplars. These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to improve the efficiency of category-level 6D object pose estimation, which is crucial in computer vision applications like virtual reality and embodied intelligence.

Method: The proposed RFM-Pose framework employs a flow-matching generative model to generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path and uses proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy within a reinforcement learning framework.

Result: Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark show that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost and can be adapted for object pose tracking with competitive results.

Conclusion: RFM-Pose offers an efficient solution for category-level 6D object pose estimation by combining flow-matching generative models and reinforcement learning, outperforming previous methods in terms of computational efficiency.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and plays a critical role in virtual reality and embodied intelligence, where agents must understand and interact with objects in 3D space. Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.

Abstract: Balancing accuracy and latency on high-resolution images is a critical challenge for lightweight models, particularly for Transformer-based architectures that often suffer from excessive latency. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ReGLA}, a series of lightweight hybrid networks, which integrates efficient convolutions for local feature extraction with ReLU-based gated linear attention for global modeling. The design incorporates three key innovations: the Efficient Large Receptive Field (ELRF) module for enhancing convolutional efficiency while preserving a large receptive field; the ReLU Gated Modulated Attention (RGMA) module for maintaining linear complexity while enhancing local feature representation; and a multi-teacher distillation strategy to boost performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: A novel prototype fine-tuning framework for few-shot class-incremental learning is proposed, achieving superior performance with minimal learnable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods suffer from representation bias and recent prompt-based tuning methods are limited by extreme data scarcity.

Method: The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets to fine-tune prototypes.

Result: Extensive results demonstrate superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters in few-shot class-incremental learning.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) seeks to continuously learn new classes from very limited samples while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the substantial computational cost incurred by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) when processing visual inputs, hindering their practical application.

Method: The approach involves a highly efficient MLLM architecture with visual token compression and a multi-stage progressive training strategy, including continue pretraining, contrastive pretraining, hard negative mining, and task-aware fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed Magic-MM-Embedding model achieves both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown immense promise in universal multimodal retrieval, which aims to find relevant items of various modalities for a given query. But their practical application is often hindered by the substantial computational cost incurred from processing a large number of tokens from visual inputs. In this paper, we propose Magic-MM-Embedding, a series of novel models that achieve both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding. Our approach is built on two synergistic pillars: (1) a highly efficient MLLM architecture incorporating visual token compression to drastically reduce inference latency and memory footprint, and (2) a multi-stage progressive training strategy designed to not only recover but significantly boost performance. This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation. Comprehensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed Fast-SAM3D framework effectively accelerates 3D reconstruction while maintaining fidelity, making it a promising solution for efficient single-view 3D generation.

Abstract: SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the \textbf{first systematic investigation} into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level \textbf{heterogeneity}: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present \textbf{Fast-SAM3D}, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) \textit{Modality-Aware Step Caching} to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) \textit{Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving} to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) \textit{Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation} to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to \textbf{2.67$\times$} end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

TL;DR: FlashBlock is a novel attention mechanism that improves the efficiency of block diffusion in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of block diffusion in long-context settings by reducing the overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache.

Method: The authors analyze the property of block diffusion and propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output.

Result: Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashBlock, achieving up to 1.44$x$ higher token throughput and 1.6$x$ reduction in attention time.

Conclusion: FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism, reduces attention computation and KV cache access, achieving up to 1.44$x$ higher token throughput and 1.6$x$ reduction in attention time with negligible impact on generation quality.

Abstract: Generating long-form content, such as minute-long videos and extended texts, is increasingly important for modern generative models. Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods were limited to perspective images, restricting their use in real-world scenarios with fisheye or panoramic cameras.

Method: Utilized a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token for distortion-aware 3D reconstruction.

Result: Wid3R outperformed prior methods, achieving up to +77.33 improvement on Stanford2D3D, and demonstrated strong zero-shot robustness.

Conclusion: Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method supporting wide field-of-view cameras, including 360 imagery.

Abstract: We present Wid3R, a feed-forward neural network for visual geometry reconstruction that supports wide field-of-view camera models. Prior methods typically assume that input images are rectified or captured with pinhole cameras, since both their architectures and training datasets are tailored to perspective images only. These assumptions limit their applicability in real-world scenarios that use fisheye or panoramic cameras and often require careful calibration and undistortion. In contrast, Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that can model wide field-of-view camera types. Our approach leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token within the network, enabling distortion-aware 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, Wid3R is the first multi-view foundation model to support feed-forward 3D reconstruction directly from 360 imagery. It demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness and consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to +77.33 on Stanford2D3D.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MTPano, a multi-task panoramic foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks through a label-free training pipeline and geometry-aware modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of comprehensive panoramic scene understanding due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations and the failure of directly adapting perspective foundation models to the panoramic domain.

Method: The proposed method involves projecting panoramic images into perspective patches to generate pseudo-labels, categorizing tasks into rotation-invariant and rotation-variant groups, and using Panoramic Dual BridgeNet with geometry-aware modulation layers and ERP token mixers.

Result: MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MTPano is a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model that effectively addresses the challenges of panoramic scene understanding through its innovative label-free training pipeline and geometry-aware modulation.

Abstract: Comprehensive panoramic scene understanding is critical for immersive applications, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations. While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, leading to failure in preserving consistency.

Method: The proposed method involves generating safe counterparts from unsafe inputs, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data, and leveraging two key components: Paired Semantic Realignment and Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed PAIR framework reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment, enabling fine-grained erasure that removes only targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency.

Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies two fundamental flaws in existing prototype-based representation learning methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption and the Learning-Inference Disconnect, which limit the model's capacity and performance.

Method: The proposed APEX framework uses a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold, introducing an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM) and a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of APEX, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed APEX framework effectively addresses the identified flaws, resulting in improved OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework, HIVE, for multimodal latent reasoning, enabling 'slow thinking' and improving the understanding of complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of multimodal large language models has led to impressive perception capabilities, but their reasoning process remains inefficient and prone to hallucination. The authors aim to develop a more robust reasoning process.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework, HIVE, which recursively extends transformer blocks and injects hierarchical visual cues into the model's latent representations, enabling grounded, multi-step inference in the aligned latent space.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed HIVE framework enables robust reasoning in a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly, and improves the understanding of complex scenes.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive perception capabilities. However, their reasoning process often remains a "fast thinking" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, "slow thinking" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.

TL;DR: The paper identifies a Simplicity Paradox in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection models, where they are sensitive to subtle OOD samples but blind to structurally distinct samples. The authors propose D-KNN, a training-free framework that decouples semantic and structural components, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the Simplicity Paradox and Geometric Blindness in existing OOD detection models, which are sensitive to semantically subtle OOD samples but fail to detect structurally distinct samples.

Method: The authors propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework that utilizes orthogonal decomposition to separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism.

Result: D-KNN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks, reducing FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3% and boosting AUROC from 79.7% to 94.9% when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, resolving the Simplicity Paradox and establishing new state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection.

Abstract: While feature-based post-hoc methods have made significant strides in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, we uncover a counter-intuitive Simplicity Paradox in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models: these models exhibit keen sensitivity in distinguishing semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from severe Geometric Blindness when confronting structurally distinct yet semantically simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. Notably, in resolving the Simplicity Paradox, it reduces the FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%; when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise, it boosts the detection performance (AUROC) from a baseline of 79.7% to 94.9%.

Conclusion: The CityGenAgent framework establishes a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation, addressing the challenges of high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation.

Abstract: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is a critical challenge with broad applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.

*Xiaoxuan He,Siming Fu,Wanli Li,Zhiyuan Li,Dacheng Yin,Kang Rong,Fengyun Rao,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAIL, a novel framework that enables diffusion models to self-improve using minimal human feedback, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with significantly less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning diffusion models with human preferences without relying on large-scale preference datasets or auxiliary reward models.

Method: SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner, generating diverse samples, self-annotating preferences, and refining itself using a self-augmented dataset, with a ranked preference mixup strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using only 6% of the preference data required by existing approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models when properly harnessed.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences remains challenging, particularly when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. \textit{This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve effective alignment using only minimal human feedback, without auxiliary reward models, by unlocking the latent capabilities within diffusion models themselves?} In this paper, we propose \textbf{SAIL} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}mplified \textbf{I}terative \textbf{L}earning), a novel framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers through iterative self-improvement. Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.

TL;DR: The authors propose VRIQ, a benchmark for assessing VLMs' visual reasoning, and find that current VLMs are unreliable due to perception limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce VRIQ, a novel benchmark to assess VLMs' visual reasoning ability, and evaluate models on abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks.

Result: VLMs perform poorly on abstract puzzles (28% accuracy) and natural tasks (45% accuracy), with perception being the main source of failures (around 56% from perception alone).

Conclusion: Current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations.

Abstract: Recent progress in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has raised the question of whether they can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning. To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that improves upon the original Dolphin by enhancing the parsing of photographed documents, finer-grained element detection, and code block recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of document parsing remains fragmented across multiple specialized models, and existing two-stage approaches have limitations in handling distorted or photographed documents.

Method: Dolphin-v2 is a two-stage model that performs document type classification and layout analysis in the first stage, and employs a hybrid parsing strategy in the second stage, handling digital-born and photographed documents differently.

Result: Dolphin-v2 demonstrates substantial improvements on various benchmarks, including +14.78 points overall on OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference.

Conclusion: The proposed Dolphin-v2 model significantly enhances document image parsing capabilities, particularly for photographed documents, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.

Conclusion: The proposed Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer achieves high image similarity and geometric accuracy, enabling MRI-only planning in radiotherapy with clinically acceptable dosimetric performance.

Abstract: MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation; however, the absence of electron density information limits its direct use for dose calculation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the computational and memory overhead of previous linear gradient matching methods for dataset distillation.

Method: The method proposed in this paper is statistical flow matching, which optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data, and a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference.

Result: The results show that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this paper is that the proposed statistical flow matching framework and classifier inheritance strategy provide a stable and efficient solution for dataset distillation, achieving substantial performance gains with reduced computational and memory overhead.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing in digital pathology, addressing the limitations of existing methods that assume feature independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the explainability and reproducibility of biomarkers in digital pathology by developing a framework that can edit pathomics features in a controllable and biologically plausible manner.

Method: The proposed method uses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn a disentangled latent space, regularizing feature trajectories to ensure that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells, and then guides a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAD framework is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features and outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.

Conclusion: The proposed MAD framework addresses the limitations of existing methods and provides a controllable and biologically plausible approach for cell nuclei editing in digital pathology, with potential applications in improving the explainability and reproducibility of biomarkers.

Abstract: Pathomics is a recent approach that offers rich quantitative features beyond what black-box deep learning can provide, supporting more reproducible and explainable biomarkers in digital pathology. However, many derived features (e.g., "second-order moment") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.

Abstract: Global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which degrade CCTV signal and video quality while disrupting traffic flow, thereby increasing traffic accident rates. Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel data-free framework for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions, eliminating reliance on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art methods for OOD detection rely on large-scale external datasets, which is infeasible in practical deployment due to data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity.

Method: The proposed framework introduces a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy and a Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) to maximize the distinction between in-distribution features and synthesized boundary outliers.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that utilize external real images.

Conclusion: The proposed data-free framework maintains superior detection performance while eliminating reliance on external datasets, making it a promising solution for OOD detection under long-tailed distributions.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges faced by existing methods in processing complex and dense cellular regions in digital pathology analysis, and to verify the effectiveness of graph coloring-based methods in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and propose Disco, an adjacency-aware framework based on the 'divide and conquer' principle.

Result: The authors release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025 and reveal that most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles, making simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues.

Conclusion: The paper proposes Disco, a novel framework for cell instance segmentation that addresses the challenges of complex and dense cellular regions by combining a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system.

Abstract: Accurate cell instance segmentation is foundational for digital pathology analysis. Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the "divide and conquer" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, "Explicit Marking" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a "conflict set." Second, "Implicit Disambiguation" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.

TL;DR: NeVStereo is a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that jointly delivers camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods either focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction or offer high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but not both. Existing methods also assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors.

Method: NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage to improve geometric consistency.

Result: NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance across various benchmarks, with improved depth error, pose accuracy, NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NeVStereo offers a single framework that can accurately deliver camera poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views, mitigating common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking and pose-depth coupling.

Abstract: In modern dense 3D reconstruction, feed-forward systems (e.g., VGGT, pi3) focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction but do not explicitly output the novel view synthesis (NVS). Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-AD model demonstrates strong generalization across multiple domains and is effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.

Motivation: The measurement of glossy surfaces using fringe projection profilometry is challenging due to specular reflection and indirect illumination, leading to distortion or loss of projected fringe patterns.

Method: The proposed LD-SLRO method encodes phase-shifted fringe images to extract latent representations, which are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model to suppress reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information.

Result: Experimental results show that LD-SLRO improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.

Conclusion: The proposed LD-SLRO method effectively addresses the challenges of measuring highly reflective surfaces, providing high-quality fringe images and accurate 3-D reconstruction.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry-based 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness remains a significant challenge. When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.

### [45] [Stable Velocity: A Variance Perspective on Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05435)
*Donglin Yang,Yongxing Zhang,Xin Yu,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Xiaojuan Qi,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Stable Velocity, a framework that improves training and sampling in flow matching by reducing variance and leveraging insights from high and low-variance regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the high-variance training targets in flow matching that destabilize optimization and slow convergence.

Method: The authors introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM) and Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA) for training, and Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS) for inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on various models demonstrate improved training efficiency and faster sampling without degrading sample quality.

Conclusion: The proposed Stable Velocity framework consistently improves training and sampling efficiency across different models and tasks.

Abstract: While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

*Natascha Jeziorski,Petra Gospodnetić,Claudia Redenbach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for generating synthetic data for automated defect detection using non-destructive testing methods, utilizing parametric models to create 3D mesh objects with synthetic defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide sufficient and high-quality training data for machine learning approaches in automated defect detection, as real data may be limited or difficult to obtain.

Method: The authors propose using rule-based approaches to generate synthetic data in a controllable environment, creating a digital twin of the inspected object with synthetic defects, and using physically based Monte Carlo simulations to create synthetic data resembling real inspection data.

Result: The result is a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set with pixel-perfect annotation, enabling the inclusion of rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their method can be applied in combination with simulations for any non-destructive testing method, demonstrating its potential for various applications, such as visual surface inspection.

Abstract: In industry, defect detection is crucial for quality control. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.

*Chang Zou,Changlin Li,Yang Li,Patrol Li,Jianbing Wu,Xiao He,Songtao Liu,Zhao Zhong,Kailin Huang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism to accelerate video generation using diffusion models, achieving an 11.8x speedup while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the rapidly escalating computational burden in video generation using diffusion models, and to improve upon existing acceleration methods such as Feature Caching and step-distillation which face issues like semantic and detail drop or quality loss.

Method: The paper employs a lightweight learnable neural predictor for diffusion models and proposes a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation.

Result: The proposed method achieves an 11.8x acceleration while preserving generation quality, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the introduced learnable feature caching mechanism effectively accelerates video generation using diffusion models without significant quality loss, pushing the acceleration boundaries.

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.

*Yue Lu,Xiangyu Zhou,Shizhou Zhang,Yinghui Xing,Guoqiang Liang,Wencong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Continual Learning (CL) for Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the issue of catastrophic forgetting in CL, specifically identifying attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of this problem.

Method: The proposed method involves a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions when learning a new task.

Result: Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts, achieving state-of-the-art performance and robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed attention-retaining framework is effective in addressing catastrophic forgetting in CL for Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

*Dekang Qi,Shuang Zeng,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Memory-Execute-Review framework for Visual Language Navigation (VLN) to improve success rate and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods struggle with both success rate and generalization, with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches achieving higher success rates and Training-Free (TF) approaches generalizing better.

Method: The proposed framework consists of a hierarchical memory module, an execute module for decision-making, and a review module for handling abnormal situations.

Result: The framework achieved significant improvements in success rate across 4 datasets, outperforming baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot settings, and surpassing SFT methods on certain datasets.

Conclusion: The Memory-Execute-Review framework demonstrates comprehensive leadership in both success rate and generalization, addressing the challenges in VLN.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is one of the fundamental capabilities for embodied intelligence and a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced SOMA-1M, a large-scale SAR-optical dataset for multi-scale foundation models, and established evaluation benchmarks for four vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets have limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, hindering the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models.

Method: Designed a coarse-to-fine image matching framework to ensure pixel-level alignment, and established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks.

Result: Supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks, achieving state-of-the-art levels in MRSI matching.

Conclusion: SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models. The dataset will be released publicly at: https://github.com/PeihaoWu/SOMA-1M.

*Julien Moreau,S. Ambellouis,Yassine Ruichek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This report is a scientific contribution including a detailed bibliography, a dataset (PFSeq), and experiments. It is a draft from a 2014 PhD thesis on constructing 3D models from fisheye video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify the best feature detector and descriptor for fisheye images in the context of self-calibration for visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes.

Method: The report involves a comprehensive experiment using a dataset called PFSeq (Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence) to evaluate feature detectors and descriptors for fisheye images.

Result: The results, though not peer-reviewed and based on 2014 data, contribute to understanding the chicken and egg problem of needing accurate projection models for optimal feature detection and good features for calibration.

Conclusion: The report concludes by highlighting its limitations, such as not contributing new feature algorithms or comparing standard algorithms to those designed for omnidirectional images, and not being updated to reflect the state-of-the-art beyond 2014.

Abstract: What is this report: This is a scientific report, contributing with a detailed bibliography, a dataset which we will call now PFSeq for ''Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence'' and make available at https://doi.org/10. 57745/DYIVVU, and comprehensive experiments. This work should be considered as a draft, and has been done during my PhD thesis ''Construction of 3D models from fisheye video data-Application to the localisation in urban area'' in 2014 [Mor16]. These results have never been published. The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately). It has not been peer-reviewed. Discussions have been translated and enhanced but the experiments have not been run again and the report has not been updated accordingly to the evolution of the state-of-the-art (read this as a 2014 report).

TL;DR: This paper proposes VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of scale drift in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, particularly on long sequences.

Method: The method involves a motion-aware submap construction mechanism using optical flow, an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy, and a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization.

Result: The result is that VGGT-Motion achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM, improving trajectory accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that VGGT-Motion effectively addresses the issues of scale drift and computational expense in calibration-free monocular SLAM, enabling scalable long-range operation.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline for robust 3D point cloud classification using structural abstraction and graph classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness in 3D point cloud classification without scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation.

Method: The method involves partitioning a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper, constructing a region graph, and performing graph classification with Graph Isomorphism Network.

Result: Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy on ModelNet40-C, particularly under Noise and Transformation corruptions, with only 0.5M parameters.

Conclusion: The study suggests that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.

Abstract: Robust 3D point cloud classification is often pursued by scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation. We instead ask whether structural abstraction alone can improve robustness, and study a simple topology-inspired decomposition based on the Mapper algorithm. We propose Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline that partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, and followed by density-based clustering), constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network. On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.

*Youngwoo Shin,Jiwan Hur,Junmo Kim*

TL;DR: This paper proposes Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG) to mitigate the train-inference discrepancy in Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, improving image generation fidelity and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of VAR models, which can drift at inference time due to limited capacity and accumulated error, causing deviation from their coarse-to-fine nature.

Method: The proposed method involves using SSG, a training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence, and Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), a frequency-domain procedure to sharpen and isolate the semantic residual.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that SSG is a effective solution to improve VAR models, and it can be applied broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Conclusion: The fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios, highlighting the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection.

Abstract: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in applications such as robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance. This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes FastVMT, a method to accelerate video motion transfer using Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture by addressing motion and gradient redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods for video motion transfer using DiT architecture have not addressed structural sources of inefficiency, leading to computational redundancy.

Method: The authors identify two types of redundancy: motion redundancy and gradient redundancy. To mitigate motion redundancy, they mask attention layers to a local neighborhood. To exploit gradient redundancy, they design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps.

Result: FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading visual fidelity or temporal consistency of generated videos.

Conclusion: The proposed FastVMT method successfully accelerates video motion transfer by addressing computational redundancy, resulting in significant speedup without compromising video quality.

Abstract: Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

Result: Evaluated state-of-the-art methods on the dataset, showing room for improvement in 6D pose estimation, object detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: IndustryShapes is a valuable resource for industrial robotics, offering a challenging and realistic benchmark for 6D pose estimation methods, with potential for future research and improvement.

Abstract: We introduce IndustryShapes, a new RGB-D benchmark dataset of industrial tools and components, designed for both instance-level and novel object 6D pose estimation approaches. The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences. We further evaluate the dataset on a representative set of state-of-the art methods for instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation, including also object detection, segmentation, showing that there is room for improvement in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models for robotic perception.

Method: The method employs modular, class-specific heads to estimate multi-class 6-DoF poses and parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data.

Result: PIRATR achieves a detection mAP of 0.919 on real outdoor LiDAR scans without fine-tuning, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception, enabling scalable, simulation-trained perception systems for dynamic robotic environments.

Abstract: We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced ViGT, a geometric model for autonomous driving that estimates 3D occupancy fields from camera rigs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a foundational geometric model for autonomous driving that prioritizes scalability, simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations.

Method: ViGT uses a calibration-free architecture and self-supervised training with synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, trained on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets.

Result: ViGT achieved state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task and comparable performance with supervised methods on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark.

Conclusion: ViGT represents a significant step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, demonstrating scalability, generalizability, and high performance.

Abstract: We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-ML framework was proposed for classifying APD subtypes vs. PD and differentiating between subtypes, achieving high AUC scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early differential diagnosis of APD subtypes remains challenging due to overlapping clinical features with PD, necessitating reliable imaging biomarkers.

Method: A hybrid framework combining CNNs with ML techniques was used to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between subtypes, leveraging multi-modal input data including T1-weighted MRI, segmentation masks, and volumetric measurements.

Result: The hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with AUC scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes, contributing to more reliable early-stage diagnosis and facilitating timely interventions.

Abstract: Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.

### [63] [LoGoSeg: Integrating Local and Global Features for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05578)
*Junyang Chen,Xiangbo Lv,Zhiqiang Kou,Xingdong Sheng,Ning Xu,Yiguo Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LoGoSeg, a single-stage framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that integrates object existence prior, region-aware alignment, and dual-stream fusion, achieving competitive performance on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSS methods relying on VLMs like CLIP often result in imprecise spatial alignment and lack strong object priors, leading to object hallucination or missed detections.

Method: LoGoSeg framework includes three key innovations: object existence prior, region-aware alignment module, and dual-stream fusion mechanism.

Result: LoGoSeg achieves competitive performance on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) and demonstrates strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

Conclusion: The proposed LoGoSeg framework efficiently addresses the challenges in OVSS by integrating object existence prior, region-aware alignment, and dual-stream fusion, eliminating the need for external mask proposals or extra datasets.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) extends traditional closed-set segmentation by enabling pixel-wise annotation for both seen and unseen categories using arbitrary textual descriptions. While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

### [64] [Geometric Observability Index: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Per-Feature Sensitivity, Weak Observability, and Dynamic Effects in SE(3) Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05582)
*Joe-Mei Feng,Sheng-Wei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduce a unified framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation, resulting in the Geometric Observability Index (GOI) that explains measurement influence and provides diagnostic signals for SLAM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical sensitivity tools do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems, motivating the authors to develop a new framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity.

Method: The authors extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3), resulting in the Geometric Observability Index (GOI) that quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace.

Result: The GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence, unifying conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator, and yields lightweight diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations.

Conclusion: The authors present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3), introducing the Geometric Observability Index (GOI) to quantify the contribution of individual measurements and explain classical degeneracies and dynamic feature amplification.

Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).
  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.
  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour, and there is a need to alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency.

Method: A mixed reality (MR) system was developed, combining virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, and a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline was implemented to achieve spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands.

Conclusion: The MR system for childbirth training achieved accurate and stable manikin localization, and MR training was preferred by trainees and achieved higher scores in delivery and overall task performance compared to VR training.

Abstract: Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are increasingly constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour. To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoPoseVR is an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR, integrating headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing head-mounted camera-based approaches for full-body pose tracking in VR, including temporal instability and inaccurate lower-body estimation.

Method: EgoPoseVR uses a dual-modality fusion pipeline, a spatiotemporal encoder, and a kinematic optimization module to estimate full-body pose.

Result: EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models and achieves higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use.

Conclusion: EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static channel-wise mixing in ViTs, relying on fixed MLPs, lacks adaptability to input content, motivating the need for a dynamic mechanism.

Method: Replaced static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction, performing spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention in each Transformer block.

Result: CAViT outperforms standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy across five benchmark datasets, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%.

Conclusion: The proposed CAViT architecture enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity, validated by qualitative attention maps showing sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a range of computer vision tasks by modeling long-range spatial interactions via self-attention. However, channel-wise mixing in ViTs remains static, relying on fixed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that lack adaptability to input content. We introduce 'CAViT', a dual-attention architecture that replaces the static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction. Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%. Qualitative attention maps reveal sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven token mixing.

*Zongliang Zhang,Shuxiang Li,Xingwang Huang,Zongyue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for robustly fitting multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fitting methods are mainly designed for classical models, and few methods can handle non-classical models. Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on reconstructing a single instance of a non-classical model.

Method: The authors formulate the multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, comprising a novel estimator based on model-to-data error and a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer.

Result: The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models.

Conclusion: The paper presents a robust method for fitting multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data, with the code available online.

Abstract: Most existing robust fitting methods are designed for classical models, such as lines, circles, and planes. In contrast, fewer methods have been developed to robustly handle non-classical models, such as spiral curves, procedural character models, and free-form surfaces. Furthermore, existing methods primarily focus on reconstructing a single instance of a non-classical model. This paper aims to reconstruct multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data. We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum. The effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzongliang/fitting.

TL;DR: This paper introduces XSIM, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving that extends 3D Gaussian splatting with rolling-shutter modeling and addresses edge cases for spherical cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve sensor simulation for autonomous driving by addressing limitations in existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods, particularly for spherical cameras.

Method: The method involves extending 3D Gaussian splatting with generalized rolling-shutter modeling, proposing a phase modeling mechanism to address azimuth boundary issues, and introducing an extended 3D Gaussian representation with dual opacity parameters.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet, with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that XSIM provides enhanced scene representations and outperforms recent baselines, with the source code publicly available.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for Automated Driving System (ADS) testing, which combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism to generate high-risk violation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in current ADS testing approaches, which have limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios and fail to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations.

Method: The method involves using a multi-head attention network to model interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors, and a traffic law weighting mechanism to evaluate violations based on severity and occurrence.

Result: The results show that ROMAN outperformed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker, achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while maintaining greater scenario diversity.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that ROMAN is a more effective and thorough approach for ADS testing, enabling the identification of more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

Abstract: Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSurg is a novel video-native foundation model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various surgical video analysis tasks by shifting the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for surgical video analysis rely on pixel-level reconstruction objectives, which waste model capacity on low-level visual details rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding.

Method: The authors propose UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that uses latent motion prediction instead of pixel-level reconstruction. It introduces motion-guided latent prediction, spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation, and feature diversity regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tasks such as surgical workflow recognition, action triplet recognition, skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various surgical video analysis tasks, establishing it as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.

Abstract: While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.

*Amir Ansari,Jana Subirana,Bruna Silva,Sergio Escalera,David Gallardo-Pujol,Cristina Palmero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data, showing that nuance-level models outperform facet and trait-level models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges posed by relying on broad trait scores as ground truth for personality recognition, which can manifest through diverse, context-dependent behaviors.

Method: The authors used a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms, trained on the UDIVA v0.5 dataset.

Result: The results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that using more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, particularly nuance-level models, enhances personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data.

Abstract: Personality is a complex, hierarchical construct typically assessed through item-level questionnaires aggregated into broad trait scores. Personality recognition models aim to infer personality traits from different sources of behavioral data. However, reliance on broad trait scores as ground truth, combined with limited training data, poses challenges for generalization, as similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context dependent behaviors. In this work, we explore the predictive impact of the more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, facets and nuances, to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data. Using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset, we trained a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms. Results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents ShapeUP, a scalable 3D editing framework that achieves precise 3D manipulation through supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of precise 3D manipulation and the trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability in existing 3D editing frameworks.

Method: ShapeUP is trained on triplets of source 3D shape, edited 2D image, and edited 3D shape, using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to learn a direct mapping.

Result: ShapeUP outperforms current baselines in identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

Conclusion: The proposed ShapeUP framework achieves fine-grained visual control, implicit mask-free localization, and strict structural consistency, making it a significant advancement in 3D editing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

### [74] [Poster: Camera Tampering Detection for Outdoor IoT Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05706)
*Shadi Attarha,Kanaga Shanmugi,Anna Förster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes two methods for detecting tampered images from smart cameras: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method, evaluating their performance in accuracy, computational demands, and training data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of smart cameras in outdoor settings for surveillance and security is undermined by tampering, which is harder to detect in still images than in video.

Method: The study proposes and evaluates two approaches: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method for detecting tampered images, and provides publicly available datasets for development and evaluation.

Result: The results show that the deep-learning model offers higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more suitable for resource-limited scenarios without prolonged calibration.

Conclusion: The study concludes that both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, and provides resources to support the development of camera tampering detection methods.

Abstract: Recently, the use of smart cameras in outdoor settings has grown to improve surveillance and security. Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.

*Yunchuan Ma,Laiyun Qing,Guorong Li,Yuqing Liu,Yuankai Qi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-task learning framework to improve point-supervised temporal action localization by explicitly modeling temporal relationships among frames of an action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point-supervised temporal action localization approaches lack explicit modeling of temporal relationships among frames of an action, which is crucial for understanding and localizing actions.

Method: A multi-task learning framework with three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: Action Completion, Action Order Understanding, and Action Regularity Understanding.

Result: Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-task learning framework effectively boosts the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization in untrimmed videos.

Abstract: Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

*Lexiang Hu,Youze Xue,Dian Li,Gang Liu,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method for generating multiple embeddings that are adaptively aggregated, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based embedding models are limited to capturing global semantic information, and complex scenarios often involve a hybrid of global and fine-grained elements, necessitating a fusion mechanism.

Method: The proposed AGFF-Embed method generates multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. It is also adapted with Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique for in-batch hard negatives enhancement.

Result: AGFF-Embed achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks compared to other multimodal embedding models.

Conclusion: The proposed AGFF-Embed method effectively fuses global and fine-grained perceptual information, outperforming existing multimodal embedding models in comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.

### [77] [Depth as Prior Knowledge for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05730)
*Moussa Kassem Sbeyti,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DepthPrior, a framework that utilizes depth information as prior knowledge to improve the detection of small and distant objects without modifying detector architectures, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting small and distant objects is challenging due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects, and depth information can improve detection. However, existing approaches require complex model-specific modifications.

Method: The DepthPrior framework consists of three components: Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. It leverages depth information to mitigate systematic performance degradation in detecting small objects.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections).

Conclusion: The proposed DepthPrior framework effectively improves the detection of small and distant objects by utilizing depth information as prior knowledge, achieving significant gains in mAP$_S$ and mAR$_S$ without modifying detector architectures or incurring additional performance costs.

Abstract: Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing using in vitro cultured cortical neurons as the physical reservoir, demonstrating its effectiveness in static visual pattern recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as a computational substrate, rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics.

Method: The method involves using a high-density multi-electrode array to stimulate and readout neural responses, and training a linear readout layer to classify the reservoir states.

Result: The system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.

*Ti Wang,Xiaohang Yu,Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FMPose3D, a novel generative pose estimation framework that uses Flow Matching to efficiently generate 3D pose samples, outperforming existing methods on various human and animal pose estimation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address the ill-posed nature of monocular 3D pose estimation due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, and to improve upon the computational efficiency of existing probabilistic methods.

Method: The authors propose a framework that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem, using Flow Matching to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), and introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module to obtain a single accurate prediction.

Result: FMPose3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and on 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D.

Conclusion: The proposed FMPose3D framework demonstrates strong performance across both 3D human and animal pose domains, and the code is made available at https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/FMPose3D.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

TL;DR: ReText, a novel method for person re-identification, is proposed to improve generalization across unseen domains by leveraging a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data with textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the domain gap in person re-identification across cameras in unseen domains. Existing approaches use complex architectures, but recent findings suggest that stylistically diverse single-camera data can achieve better generalization.

Method: ReText is trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, with the latter being complemented by textual descriptions. It jointly optimizes three tasks: Re-ID on multi-camera data, image-text matching, and image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReText is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID, achieving strong generalization across unseen domains.

Abstract: Generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across cameras in unseen domains without retraining. While multiple existing approaches address the domain gap through complex architectures, recent findings indicate that better generalization can be achieved by stylistically diverse single-camera data. Although this data is easy to collect, it lacks complexity due to minimal cross-view variation. We propose ReText, a novel method trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, where the latter is complemented by textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues. During training, ReText jointly optimizes three tasks: (1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, (2) image-text matching, and (3) image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data. Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID.

*Hengyi Wang,Ruiqiang Zhang,Chang Liu,Guanjie Wang,Zehua Ma,Han Fang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that enhances allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for spatially grounded tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: The Allocentric Perceiver recovers metric 3D states from images using geometric experts and instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame, offloading mental rotation to explicit computation.

Result: Consistent and substantial gains (~10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The Allocentric Perceiver is a significant improvement for VLMs in handling allocentric spatial queries, enhancing their spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.

*Enwei Tong,Yuanchao Bai,Yao Zhu,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new pruning framework, Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), is proposed to improve the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs) by balancing local evidence and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods for VLMs struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression, leading to increased inference latency and memory footprint.

Method: FSR is a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that involves three steps: focusing on key evidence, scanning for complementary context, and refining the scanned context by aggregating relevant details.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FSR framework offers a practical remedy for reducing the inference latency and memory footprint of VLMs while maintaining their accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NVS-HO, a benchmark for novel view synthesis of handheld objects using RGB inputs, and evaluates current methods, revealing significant performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects by providing a challenging real-world benchmark.

Method: The method involves recording objects in two complementary RGB sequences: handheld and board sequences, and training NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting using different pose estimators.

Result: The experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions.

Conclusion: NVS-HO offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Abstract: We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SparseVideoNav, a novel approach for Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN) tasks, achieving a 27x speed-up and 2.5x success rate compared to state-of-the-art LLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for autonomous navigation in unknown environments guided by simple and high-level intents, rather than detailed and verbose language instructions.

Method: The authors propose introducing a video generation model into the BVN field and develop SparseVideoNav, which achieves sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon.

Result: The results show that SparseVideoNav achieves a 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart and a 2.5x success rate compared to state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks, with the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SparseVideoNav is a significant advancement in BVN tasks, enabling efficient and effective navigation in unknown environments with simple and high-level intents.

Abstract: Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning approaches have limitations, such as representational mismatch and restricted perceptual acuity, in video reasoning tasks.

Method: Weaver is an end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system that empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools and integrates a reinforcement learning algorithm to explore strategies for employing and combining these tools.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Weaver enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

Conclusion: The proposed Weaver system addresses the limitations of existing approaches and improves video reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer in online Reinforcement Learning (RL) for GUI agents.

Method: The authors propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, using Stratified Group Sampling and a Self-Evolving Loop.

Result: Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies.

Conclusion: UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

*Pierre-François De Plaen,Abhishek Jha,Luc Van Gool,Tinne Tuytelaars,Marc Proesmans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese self-supervised learning (SSL) that stabilizes multi-crop training and improves performance on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the instability issue in predictor-based SSL architectures, such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3, when using the multi-crop strategy.

Method: The authors propose assigning a separate predictor to each view type and treating each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task, incorporating cutout views where part of the image is masked before encoding.

Result: The proposed approach stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains on ImageNet using ResNet and ViT models.

Conclusion: The paper presents a simple and effective multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that is generally applicable across backbones and consistently improves performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on Siamese networks learn visual representations by aligning different views of the same image. The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The authors introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free method that calibrates intermediate stochastic states to mitigate drift in long-sequence video generation, achieving comparable quality to training-based methods with negligible overhead.

Abstract: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.

Abstract: Boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects is an important problem with applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring and manufacturing, where many of these applications are plagued with scarce labeled data and low in situ computational resources. While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size <500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.

### [90] [EoCD: Encoder only Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05882)
*Mubashir Noman,Mustansar Fiaz,Hiyam Debary,Abdul Hannan,Shah Nawaz,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an encoder-only change detection (EoCD) method, simplifying change detection by early fusion and a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module, achieving a balance between performance and prediction speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods either use Siamese encoder with complex decoders or early fusion with inferior performance; the proposed EoCD aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: The EoCD method performs early fusion of temporal data and uses a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module instead of a decoder, reducing model complexity.

Result: EoCD achieves an optimal balance between change detection performance and prediction speed across various encoder architectures, and extensive experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed EoCD method simplifies change detection by making the encoder the primary component, showing that decoder is an additional component, and achieves a good balance between performance and speed.

Abstract: Being a cornerstone of temporal analysis, change detection has been playing a pivotal role in modern earth observation. Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for reconstructing 3D cardiac shapes from sparse CTA planes is proposed, achieving high accuracy and lower volume errors than the clinical standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quantitative analysis of cardiac anatomy and function by reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from sparse planes in CT angiography for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.

Method: The method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct 3D cardiac shapes from sparse CTA planes, with a multi-layer perceptron learning shape priors from 3D segmentations of target structures.

Result: The approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 and markedly lower volume errors than Simpson's biplane rule for the left ventricle and left atrium.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 and lower volume errors than Simpson's biplane rule, suggesting a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D TTE.

Abstract: Accurate 3D representations of cardiac structures allow quantitative analysis of anatomy and function. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium. This suggests that our approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CLIP-Map, a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework that outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high memory and computation cost of CLIP, which prohibits its usage in resource-limited application scenarios.

Method: The proposed method leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, and uses Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with significant gains observed under high compression settings.

Conclusion: The proposed CLIP-Map framework is effective in preserving the feature presentation ability of CLIP while reducing its memory and computation cost.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.

*Junwan Kim,Jiho Park,Seonghu Jeon,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a condition-dependent source distribution for flow matching in text-to-image generation, showing improved performance and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve upon existing flow matching approaches by optimizing the source distribution, which is typically set as a standard Gaussian distribution.

Method: The authors propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under the flow matching objective, incorporating variance regularization and directional alignment to address potential failure modes.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates consistent and robust improvements across multiple text-to-image benchmarks, with up to a 3x faster convergence in FID.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that principled design of the source distribution is beneficial for conditional flow matching, highlighting the importance of appropriate regularization and representation space choice.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.

### [94] [Multi-Scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning for Continual Test-time Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05937)
*Lingrui Li,Yanfeng Zhou,Nan Pu,Xin Chen,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning (MGIPT) to address the challenge of distribution shift in medical images across different clinical centers, enhancing Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) for semantic segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in existing CTTA methods, including error accumulation, catastrophic forgetting, lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and risk of privacy leakage.

Method: The proposed MGIPT method involves two key components: Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt (AIP) and Multi-scale Global-level Prompt (MGP), combined through a weighted ensemble approach to achieve dual-level adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

Conclusion: MGIPT effectively enhances scale diversity of prompts and captures both global- and instance-level knowledge, mitigating error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, thus improving CTTA for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable video generation methods require control signals at inference time, limiting their utility as scalable data engines. The motivation is to develop a method that can generate temporally consistent videos without the need for external control signals.

Method: The proposed method, LSA, fine-tunes pre-trained video generation models by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. It uses a semantic feature consistency loss combined with the standard diffusion loss.

Result: The model fine-tuned with LSA outperforms baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LSA in enhancing temporal consistency.

Conclusion: LSA is a simple yet effective framework that enhances temporal consistency in video generation without requiring external control signals during inference. It achieves this without adding computational overheads.

Abstract: Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.

Conclusion: The paper provides the community with a rigorous and automated evaluation standard for visual generation tasks based on GenArena.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of visual generation models has outpaced traditional evaluation approaches, necessitating the adoption of Vision-Language Models as surrogate judges. In this work, we systematically investigate the reliability of the prevailing absolute pointwise scoring standard, across a wide spectrum of visual generation tasks. Our analysis reveals that this paradigm is limited due to stochastic inconsistency and poor alignment with human perception. To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation. Crucially, our experiments uncover a transformative finding that simply adopting this pairwise protocol enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. Notably, our method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.86 with the authoritative LMArena leaderboard, drastically surpassing the 0.36 correlation of pointwise methods. Based on GenArena, we benchmark state-of-the-art visual generation models across diverse tasks, providing the community with a rigorous and automated evaluation standard for visual generation.

*Jie Deng,Kaichun Yao,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisRefiner is a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs, improving screenshot-to-code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code, unlike human developers who iteratively render and compare their implementation with the design.

Method: VisRefiner constructs difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits and introduces a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement.

Result: VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, and endows models with strong self-refinement ability.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

Abstract: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Context Forcing, a novel framework for real-time long video generation that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher, eliminating the student-teacher mismatch and enabling long-term consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation suffer from a student-teacher mismatch due to the teacher's limited context length, capping the student's ability to capture global temporal dependencies.

Method: The proposed Context Forcing framework uses a long-context teacher to train a long-context student, and introduces a Slow-Fast Memory architecture to reduce visual redundancy and make the training computationally feasible.

Result: Extensive results demonstrate that Context Forcing enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and preserves superior consistency across long durations.

Conclusion: Context Forcing is a novel framework that resolves the student-teacher mismatch in real-time long video generation, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.

*David Shavin,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Splat and Distill, a framework that enhances 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with 3D awareness by using a feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline to lift 2D features into 3D Gaussian representation and then distill the knowledge into a student model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs lack 3D awareness despite their success in 2D tasks. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: The framework uses a teacher model to produce 2D features, lifts them into 3D Gaussian representation, and then 'splats' them onto novel viewpoints to create 2D feature maps that supervise a student model.

Result: The method outperforms prior works in downstream tasks such as monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness and enhancing 2D feature richness.

Conclusion: Splat and Distill successfully instills 3D awareness into 2D VFMs, improving their performance on various tasks and enriching 2D features.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval approaches are largely language-driven and lack the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, leading to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases.

Method: V-Retrver reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection, using external visual tools to perform a multimodal interleaved reasoning process.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (23.0% on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed V-Retrver framework improves multimodal retrieval by incorporating evidence-driven reasoning, and the curriculum-based learning strategy effectively trains the retrieval agent.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.

### [102] [InterPrior: Scaling Generative Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06035)
*Sirui Xu,Samuel Schulter,Morteza Ziyadi,Xialin He,Xiaohan Fei,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liangyan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InterPrior, a scalable framework for humanoid robots to learn whole-body interactions with objects through imitation pretraining and reinforcement learning, enabling composition and generalization of loco-manipulation skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans plan interactions with objects at a high level, and the paper aims to enable humanoids to achieve similar whole-body coordination by scaling motion priors.

Method: The authors propose InterPrior, a framework that uses large-scale imitation pretraining and reinforcement learning to learn a unified generative controller. It involves distilling an imitation expert into a goal-conditioned variational policy, data augmentation with physical perturbations, and reinforcement learning finetuning.

Result: InterPrior successfully reconstructs training behaviors and generalizes to unseen goals and initializations, incorporating new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. It is demonstrated to be effective for user-interactive control and has potential for real robot deployment.

Conclusion: The InterPrior framework enables humanoid robots to learn and generalize whole-body interactions with objects, achieving physically coherent coordination and demonstrating potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

### [103] [Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037)
*Haoyuan Li,Qihang Cao,Tao Tang,Kun Xiang,Zihan Guo,Jianhua Han,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes GeoThinker, a framework for active perception in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench and demonstrating robust generalization across complex downstream scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of existing integration strategies for geometric priors in Multimodal Large Language Models, which often result in semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals.

Method: The proposed GeoThinker framework employs Spatial-Grounded Fusion and Importance Gating to selectively retrieve and integrate task-relevant geometric evidence, enabling active perception in spatial reasoning.

Result: GeoThinker achieves a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench and demonstrates robust generalization and improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence, and GeoThinker represents a significant step forward in this direction.

Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker.

*Jintao Tong,Shilin Yan,Hongwei Xue,Xiaojun Tang,Kunyu Shi,Guannan Zhang,Ruixuan Li,Yixiong Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SwimBird, a multimodal large language model that dynamically switches between text-only, vision-only, and interleaved vision-text reasoning modes, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models are limited by their rigid, pre-defined reasoning patterns, which cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries.

Method: The authors adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset.

Result: SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods on various benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding.

Conclusion: By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.

*Xuejun Zhang,Aditi Tiwari,Zhenhailong Wang,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework for 3D understanding and reasoning from multiple views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of multi-image spatial reasoning in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in perspective taking.

Method: CAMCUE uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning, injecting per-view pose into visual tokens and synthesizing a pose-conditioned imagined target view.

Result: CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and achieves over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold.

Conclusion: The proposed CAMCUE framework enables fast and accurate 3D understanding and reasoning from multiple views, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example.

Abstract: Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.

*Deepak Gupta,Davis Bartels,Dina Demner-Fuhsman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions necessitates evaluating the quality of generated answers and references.

Method: The BioACE framework evaluates multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, using automated approaches and comparing them with human evaluations.

Result: The authors provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as part of the BioACE evaluation package.

Conclusion: The BioACE framework is proposed as a solution to the challenge of evaluating text generated by LLMs in the biomedical domain, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.

*Zexin Lin,Jiachen Yu,Haoyang Zhang,Yuzhao Li,Zhonghang Li,Yujiu Yang,Junjie Wang,Xiaoqiang Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoWork-X, a framework for real-time coordination and adaptation in cooperative tasks, achieving stable performance gains and reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to cooperative tasks have limitations, such as inducing latency or being difficult to compile into reliable execution. The authors aim to address these challenges.

Method: The proposed CoWork-X framework consists of a Skill-Agent that executes tasks via HTN-based skill retrieval and a Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with budget constraints and drift regularization.

Result: Experiments in Overcooked-AI-like benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while reducing online latency and token usage.

Conclusion: CoWork-X is a promising framework for cooperative tasks, enabling real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under strict online token budgets.

Abstract: Large language models are enabling language-conditioned agents in interactive environments, but highly cooperative tasks often impose two simultaneous constraints: sub-second real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under a strict online token budget. Existing approaches either rely on frequent in-episode reasoning that induces latency and timing jitter, or deliver post-episode improvements through unstructured text that is difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution. We propose CoWork-X, an active co-evolution framework that casts peer collaboration as a closed-loop optimization problem across episodes, inspired by fast--slow memory separation. CoWork-X instantiates a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN (hierarchical task network)-based skill retrieval from a structured, interpretable, and compositional skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization. Experiments in challenging Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while steadily reducing online latency and token usage.

TL;DR: Multilingual LMs under-perform monolingual LMs due to capacity limitations. The 'multilingual penalty' was quantified using human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why multilingual language models sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations.

Method: Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in English and Spanish.

Result: Multilingual LMs show reduced performance, and three potential capacity constraints were identified: representational, attentional, and vocabulary-related limitations.

Conclusion: Multilingual LMs suffer from multiple capacity constraints that correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Locas, a novel parametric memory mechanism for transformers that enables efficient continual learning and can be flexibly merged into or offloaded from model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly used with model parameters, enabling efficient continual learning and minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The authors propose Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers. They discuss two variants of Locas and validate its performance on language modeling and question answering tasks.

Result: The results show that Locas is capable of storing information from past context with minimal additional parameters, maintaining a smaller context window, and minimizing catastrophic forgetting of existing internal knowledge.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Locas is a promising approach for permanentizing past context into parametric knowledge, enabling efficient continual learning, and minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide mathematical analysis and statistical guarantees for the quality of synthetic data generated by transformer models, particularly LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled training data and the uncertainty of synthetic data generated by black-box transformer models motivates the proposal of DKPS to provide a foundation for mathematical analysis and performance guarantees.

Method: The paper mathematically derives DKPS and shows how it provides performance guarantees for downstream tasks such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO).

Result: The proposed DKPS provides concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models, elucidating the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the current work and future research directions, providing a foundation for further analysis and improvement of transformer models.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations and proposes a multimodal approach for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of implicit discourse relation classification is challenging as it requires inferring meaning from context, and contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages.

Method: The authors propose an automatic method to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset and a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio.

Result: The results show that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal approach for implicit discourse relation classification across languages.

Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The authors introduce GreekMMLU, a native-sourced benchmark for massive multitask language understanding in Greek, and evaluate over 80 LLMs, revealing performance gaps and providing insights for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multilingual corpora that include Greek, yet reliable evaluation benchmarks for Greek-particularly those based on authentic, native-sourced content-remain limited. Existing datasets are often machine-translated from English, failing to capture Greek linguistic and cultural characteristics. We introduce GreekMMLU, a native-sourced benchmark for massive multitask language understanding in Greek, comprising 21,805 multiple-choice questions across 45 subject areas, organized under a newly defined subject taxonomy and annotated with educational difficulty levels spanning primary to professional examinations. All questions are sourced or authored in Greek from academic, professional, and governmental exams. We publicly release 16,857 samples and reserve 4,948 samples for a private leaderboard to enable robust and contamination-resistant evaluation. Evaluations of over 80 open- and closed-source LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, as well as between Greek-adapted models and general multilingual ones. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of factors influencing performance-including model scale, adaptation, and prompting-and derive insights for improving LLM capabilities in Greek.

*Ziyuan Yang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the risks of using multiple language models (LMs) in collaboration and finds that malicious models can severely impact system performance, especially in reasoning and safety domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate the potential safety risks associated with the increasing use of multiple language models in collaboration, particularly when some of these models may be compromised or malicious.

Method: The authors engineered four categories of malicious LMs, integrated them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluated the compromised system's performance across 10 datasets.

Result: The results show that malicious models significantly lower the performance of multi-LLM systems, particularly in reasoning and safety domains, with average performance reductions of 7.12% and 7.94%, respectively.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while mitigation strategies, such as employing external supervisors to oversee model collaboration, can recover a significant portion (95.31% on average) of the initial performance, making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve model collaboration efficiency by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model and introducing a single-multi evolution loop, achieving significant improvements in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combine the strengths of diverse language models while reducing the cost of loading multiple models.

Method: The authors propose a method to improve the efficiency of model collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model and introducing a single-multi evolution loop.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improvements in individual models and the overall collaboration system.

Conclusion: The proposed model collaboration and single-multi evolution loop improve individual models by 8.0% on average and the overall collaboration system by 14.9% on average.

Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.

*Hsuan-Yu Chou,Wajiha Naveed,Shuyan Zhou,Xiaowei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of open-weight and proprietary large language models (LLMs) for social media moderation, finding that open-weight LLMs can achieve comparable performance to proprietary ones and support privacy-preserving moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for effective moderation of harmful content on the internet motivates the research, which aims to assess the capability of LLMs for moderation tasks.

Method: The authors evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs (four proprietary and three open-weight) using real-world posts, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors.

Result: The results show a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity and specificity of open-weight LLMs and proprietary ones, with specificity exceeding sensitivity for rudeness detection and the opposite holding for intolerance and threats.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and highlight considerations for deploying LLMs in moderation contexts, balancing community values with individual user preferences.

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

### [116] [Aligning Large Language Model Behavior with Human Citation Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05205)
*Kenichiro Ando,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzed LLM citation behavior and compared it to human preferences, finding both alignment and discrepancies, and demonstrated that model behavior can be calibrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to explore how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled, as previous research had focused on what reference documents to link to outputs but not on the citation behavior of LLMs themselves.

Method: The authors constructed a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior by categorizing web-derived texts into eight citation-motivation types and evaluating pairwise citation preferences.

Result: The results showed that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency, but current models overemphasize text explicitly marked as needing citations and underselect numeric sentences and sentences containing personal names.

Conclusion: This study analyzed the citation behavior of large-scale language models (LLMs) and compared it to human citation preferences, finding both alignment and discrepancies, and demonstrated that model behavior can be calibrated using Direct Preference Optimization.

Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.

### [117] [Quantifying the Knowledge Proximity Between Academic and Industry Research: An Entity and Semantic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05211)
*Hongye Zhao,Yi Zhao,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the knowledge proximity between academia and industry, proposing a fine-grained method to quantify their co-evolution through entities and semantic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on academia-industry knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators, lacking an analysis of knowledge units, which has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity.

Method: The study extracts fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measures sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, analyzes topological features through complex network analysis, and employs unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces.

Result: Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change, providing textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution.

Conclusion: The study provides a fine-grained understanding of academia-industry knowledge proximity, showing that academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts, and provides a dataset and code for further research.

Abstract: The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution. Additionally, academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, outperforming existing models in audio understanding and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio foundation models rely on task-specific supervision, whereas human intelligence processes audio holistically. The authors aim to bridge this gap by developing a model that can interpret audio comprehensively.

Method: The authors pre-trained Bagpiper on 600B tokens to establish a bidirectional mapping between raw audio and high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, they adopted a caption-then-process workflow to solve diverse tasks.

Result: Bagpiper outperformed Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpassed CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, achieving unified understanding generation for general audio.

Conclusion: The paper presents Bagpiper as a significant advancement in audio foundation models, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects, and making the model, data, and code publicly available.

Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.

*Zhilin Liang,Yuxiang Wang,Zimu Zhou,Hainan Zhang,Boyi Liu,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedMosaic is a federated RAG framework that enhances LLMs with external knowledge while preserving privacy and reducing storage and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RAG deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy-aware domains. FedRAG is motivated by the need to collaborate with distributed silos without sharing raw documents.

Method: FedMosaic adopts a parametric approach, clustering semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks, and performs selective adapter aggregation.

Result: FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, without sharing raw documents.

Conclusion: FedMosaic is a novel federated RAG framework that effectively balances the trade-off between factuality, privacy, and efficiency in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex nature of copyright law necessitates a more dynamic approach than static classification for assessing copyright infringement.

Method: The system integrates multiple detection paradigms such as content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification within an interactive and extensible framework.

Result: Copyright Detective enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage, supporting responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks.

Conclusion: The system allows for the detection, analysis, and visualization of potential copyright risks in LLM outputs, facilitating compliance with copyright law.

Abstract: We present Copyright Detective, the first interactive forensic system for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs. The system treats copyright infringement versus compliance as an evidence discovery process rather than a static classification task due to the complex nature of copyright law. It integrates multiple detection paradigms, including content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification, within a unified and extensible framework. Through interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows, our system enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage, supporting responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks even with black-box access.

*Haoran Li,Sucheng Ren,Alan Yuille,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoPE, a method that unifies out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling for Rotary Positional Embedding in Large Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art length generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to unify the guiding principles of adapting Rotary Positional Embedding to longer contexts in Large Language Models, which currently fall into two categories: out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling.

Method: The method involves a minimalist intervention called CoPE, which applies soft clipping to low-frequency components of Rotary Positional Embedding.

Result: The results show that CoPE yields significant performance gains for context lengths up to 256k, validating the theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that CoPE successfully unifies out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling, eliminating outliers, refining semantic signals, and preventing spectral leakage, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance in length generalization.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proposing a new algorithm, Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO), to address response length bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why different RLVR algorithms exhibit varying response lengths during training and to address the issue of response length collapse.

Method: The paper conducts a theoretical analysis of mainstream RLVR algorithms, validates the theory through experiments, and proposes the LUSPO algorithm to rectify length bias in existing methods like GSPO.

Result: LUSPO achieves superior performance across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, representing a state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LUSPO effectively addresses the issue of response length bias, providing a novel optimization strategy for RLVR applications in LLMs and VLMs.

Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified scientific framework for optimizing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) by introducing a collaboration gain metric and a factor attribution paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of MAS lacks a unified and principled scientific framework, relying heavily on empirical trial-and-error due to the ambiguity of attribution.

Method: The authors propose establishing a collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets and construct a systematic MAS factor library to structure the design space.

Result: The framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a transition to design science through an integrated framework, enabling systematic optimization and improvement of MAS.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

*Haojin Wang,Yike Wang,Shangbin Feng,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method between large reasoning models (LRMs) and small language models (SLMs), where LRMs selectively guide SLMs to improve performance on multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the strengths of both LRMs and SLMs, as LRMs achieve strong performance but have high inference costs, while SLMs are efficient but struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks.

Method: The proposed method, MentorCollab, involves an LRM guiding an SLM at inference time by probing for divergences between the two models at randomly sampled token positions and using a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow the LRM's guidance or continue on its own.

Result: The results show that MentorCollab improves performance in 12 out of 15 SLM-LRM pairs across 3 domains, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while using only 18.4% of tokens generated by the LRM on average.

Conclusion: The study concludes that selective inference-time guidance from LRMs can restore large-model reasoning ability in SLMs without substantial inference overhead, and that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.

TL;DR: The abstract discusses how language models implicitly encode character-level information and analyzes the mechanisms behind this phenomenon by comparing LMs trained under different settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the mechanisms underlying language models' implicit encoding of character-level information despite not being explicitly provided during training.

Method: The method involves analyzing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, and comparing them with those trained under standard settings to identify contributing factors.

Result: The analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints are primary factors arising from tokenization, while semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information are key factors independent of tokenization.

Conclusion: The study concludes by categorizing the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization and those that are dependent, providing insights into how language models acquire character-level knowledge.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have been reported to implicitly encode character-level information, despite not being explicitly provided during training. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. To reveal the mechanisms, we analyze how models acquire character-level knowledge by comparing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, with those trained under standard settings. We categorize the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization. Our analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary factors arising from tokenization, whereas semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information function as key factors independent of tokenization.

TL;DR: This paper challenges the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks and introduces PACE, a new method that outperforms the previous best method while using less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the scaling hypothesis in Iterative Direct Preference Optimization and to address the issue of diminishing returns and policy collapse caused by aggressive exploration in mathematical reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce PACE, a Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration method, which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy to synthesize high-fidelity preference pairs.

Result: PACE outperforms DPO-R1 while using only about 1/5 of the compute and demonstrates superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that PACE is a more efficient and effective method for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks, and it mitigates the issues caused by aggressive exploration in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of LLMs being English-centric and to understand the performance discrepancies in low-resource languages for medical tasks.

Method: The study conducts a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering, including tokenization analysis and reliability analysis.

Result: The findings reveal a language-driven performance gap, structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, and limited correlation between model-reported confidence and correctness.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and are costly in enterprise deployment.

Method: IESR leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model.

Result: IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LogicCat and Archer datasets using compact lightweight models without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed IESR framework addresses the limitations of current Text-to-SQL methods and highlights important directions for future research on biases and deficiencies in coder models.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

*Jiyun Chun,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White,Andrew Perrault*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue, assessing response quality along Expansion and Independence axes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating children's utterances are insufficient as they are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality.

Method: The framework first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along Expansion and Independence axes.

Result: The metrics established developmental validity, demonstrated predictive value, and confirmed semantic sensitivity, aligning with human judgments and enabling large-scale evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shifts child utterance assessment from measuring length to evaluating the meaningful contribution of the child's speech to the conversation within its context.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm to accelerate the training of larger LLMs by leveraging existing small pretrained models, achieving significant speedup and improvement in downstream task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs, the question of whether existing small pretrained models can be used to accelerate the training of larger models remains underexplored, motivating the development of the LET paradigm.

Method: The LET paradigm guides the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained model, driven by late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness, achieving up to 1.6× speedup and nearly 5% improvement in downstream task accuracy when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm accelerates the training of larger Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging existing small pretrained models, achieving up to 1.6× speedup and nearly 5% improvement in downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose OPUS, a dynamic data selection framework that improves pre-training efficiency and achieves superior performance in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Data Wall phenomenon is occurring as high-quality public text approaches exhaustion, and pre-training is shifting from more tokens to better tokens. Existing methods have limitations, such as relying on heuristic static filters or using dynamic yet optimizer-agnostic criteria.

Method: The authors propose OPUS, a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. It scores candidates by projecting their effective updates onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. Techniques like Ghost with CountSketch and Boltzmann sampling are employed for computational efficiency and data diversity.

Result: OPUS achieves superior performance in pre-training GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens. It also improves pre-training efficiency when combined with industrial-level static filters, even with lower-quality data. In continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens.

Conclusion: OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales, outperforming industrial-level baselines and full 200B-token training. It also demonstrates significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.

Abstract: As high-quality public text approaches exhaustion, a phenomenon known as the Data Wall, pre-training is shifting from more tokens to better tokens. However, existing methods either rely on heuristic static filters that ignore training dynamics, or use dynamic yet optimizer-agnostic criteria based on raw gradients. We propose OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. OPUS scores candidates by projecting their effective updates, shaped by modern optimizers, onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. To ensure scalability, we employ Ghost technique with CountSketch for computational efficiency, and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity, incurring only 4.7\% additional compute overhead. OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales. In pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens, OPUS outperforms industrial-level baselines and even full 200B-token training. Moreover, when combined with industrial-level static filters, OPUS further improves pre-training efficiency, even with lower-quality data. Furthermore, in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens, demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.

### [132] [Grammatical Error Correction Evaluation by Optimally Transporting Edit Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05419)
*Takumi Goto,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, for evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, which improves evaluation performance and provides interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing reference-based metrics in GEC, such as BERTScore, which are often ineffective due to unchanged words in source sentences.

Method: The authors propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce UOT-ERRANT, a new metric that uses unbalanced optimal transport to measure similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences based on edits from the source sentence.

Result: Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain, and provides a highly interpretable transport plan that can be seen as a soft edit alignment.

Conclusion: UOT-ERRANT is a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems, and the code is available at https://github.com/gotutiyan/uot-errant.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems. Our code is available from https://github.com/gotutiyan/uot-errant.

*Basel Mousi,Fahim Dalvi,Shammur Chowdhury,Firoj Alam,Nadir Durrani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduced M2CQA, a benchmark for culturally grounded multimodal evaluation, and proposed CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR) to measure hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test the failure mode of VLMs accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations, particularly outside Western contexts and English.

Method: Built M2CQA from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects, and proposed CFHR to measure counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement.

Result: CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Reasoning-first prompting increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness.

Conclusion: The experimental resources and dataset will be made publicly available for the community, providing a new benchmark for evaluating VLMs in a culturally grounded multimodal setting.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Causal Front-Door Adjustment Attack (CFA^2) to jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever confounding associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover the inherent capabilities of LLMs by jailbreaking them, as their safety alignment mechanisms often operate as latent internal states, obscuring their capabilities.

Method: The method involves modeling the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective and employing Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that CFA^2 achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a framework for robust jailbreaking of LLMs, providing insights into their safety mechanisms and inherent capabilities.

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification, addressing challenges of emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to handle emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision in multilingual emotion identification, which is crucial for intelligent decision-making.

Method: The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization, an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism, and a mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization.

Result: The experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, Reasoning under Ambiguity, effectively addresses the challenges of multilingual multi-label emotion classification under partial supervision, showing improved performance and robustness.

Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cross-architecture merging framework for transferring knowledge from large language models to smaller models, achieving improved performance on low-resource targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between the strong capabilities of large language models and the need for smaller models in real-world deployments, by transferring knowledge from large high-resource models to smaller low-resource targets.

Method: The authors propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models, and then use the resulting transport plans to guide direct weight-space fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains show consistent improvements over target models, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport enables effective knowledge transfer from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets, demonstrating consistent improvements over target models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interactive framework for LLMs to generate and refine Cypher graph queries on Knowledge Graphs, improving accessibility and factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains, such as hallucinations and limited explainability, and the challenges of text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in multi-hop reasoning.

Method: The authors propose an interactive framework where LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries, and users refine them through natural language, and evaluate it on synthetic and real-world Knowledge Graphs.

Result: The framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor, and provides insight into model performance variation across domains.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed interactive framework is effective in improving the accessibility and accuracy of Knowledge Graph querying, and highlights the importance of evaluating model performance across different domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm to improve large language models' performance across diverse tasks, achieving substantial improvements in worst-task performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of imbalanced outcomes and distorted optimization signals in multi-task adaptation of GRPO, which is used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose a Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that dynamically adapts task weights and introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights.

Result: Experiments show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy, achieving 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively. MT-GRPO also requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting.

Conclusion: The proposed MT-GRPO algorithm outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy and achieves substantial improvements in worst-task performance while maintaining competitive average accuracy.

Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and a benchmark called CASTLE to evaluate the safety of large language models in education, highlighting the limitations of existing safety evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the safety risks posed by large language models in education, particularly for vulnerable groups, as existing safety evaluations fail to capture the divergent harms caused by the same response across different student attributes.

Method: The authors construct CASTLE based on educational theories, covering 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, and design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, Emotional Empathy, and Student Alignment.

Result: Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge, with all models scoring below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

Conclusion: The study concludes that existing large language models have significant limitations in ensuring personalized safety in education, highlighting the need for further research and development in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

TL;DR: This study examines how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Hebrew, finding that tokenization strategies significantly impact model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to understand how transformer models handle complex verb paradigms in morphologically rich languages like Turkish and Modern Hebrew, and how tokenization affects this ability.

Method: The authors used the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data to investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms, examining the impact of different tokenization strategies.

Result: The results show that for Turkish, both monolingual and multilingual models succeed regardless of tokenization strategy, while for Hebrew, model performance varies significantly with tokenization and model type.

Conclusion: The study concludes that transformer models' ability to represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew is influenced by tokenization strategies, with varying success across monolingual and multilingual models.

Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.

Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-domain machine translation that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of domain adaptation in large language models for multi-domain machine translation, as existing methods suffer from domain shift, parameter interference, and limited generalization.

Method: The proposed method identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within large language models by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, and fine-tunes the models guided by these neurons.

Result: The results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms strong parameter-efficient fine-tuning baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework is effective in mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting, enabling large language models to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances.

Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that achieves high parameter efficiency and execution speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE designs face a trade-off between expert specialization granularity and hardware execution efficiency, motivating the need for a new framework.

Method: OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, a Cartesian Product Router, and Expert-Centric Scheduling to improve MoE performance.

Result: OmniMoE achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks and reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms.

Conclusion: OmniMoE demonstrates that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be both fast and accurate, outperforming coarse-grained and fine-grained baselines.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

*Hao Yang,Zhiyu Yang,Xupeng Zhang,Wei Wei,Yunjie Zhang,Lin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CompactRAG, a framework for knowledge-intensive question answering that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning, achieving competitive accuracy while reducing token consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-hop RAG systems are inefficient due to repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops.

Method: The proposed CompactRAG framework involves an offline stage where an LLM converts the corpus into an atomic QA knowledge base, and an online stage where complex queries are decomposed, rewritten, and resolved through dense retrieval and RoBERTa-based answer extraction.

Result: Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines.

Conclusion: The CompactRAG framework provides a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.

*Bowen Ping,Zijun Chen,Yiyao Yu,Tingfeng Hui,Junchi Yan,Baobao Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes LongR, a framework that enhances long-context performance in LLM reasoning by integrating a 'Think-and-Read' mechanism with a contextual density reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of performing rigorous deduction in long-context scenarios, where existing efforts have limitations in guiding complex long-context reasoning with sparse rewards.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework called LongR, which combines a dynamic 'Think-and-Read' mechanism with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain.

Result: LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms and provides insights into the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

TL;DR: This paper examines the effectiveness of automated techniques in detecting generated text in academia, specifically in the Czech language setting, and finds no systematic bias against non-native speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The release of ChatGPT has raised concerns about the misuse of LLM-based assistants in academia, and the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text.

Method: The authors revisit previous statements about the bias of detectors against non-native speakers, examine detectors from three separate families, and analyze the role of perplexity in detection.

Result: The study finds that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers, and that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that there is no systematic bias against non-native speakers in the detectors examined, and that contemporary detectors are effective in detecting generated text.

Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method for learning action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents, achieving significant gains on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents, as LLMs struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics.

Method: The authors propose RWML, a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models using sim-to-real gap rewards, aligning simulated next states with realized next states in a pre-trained embedding space.

Result: The method achieves significant gains over the base model on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench, outperforming direct task-success reward RL and matching the performance of expert-data training.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that RWML provides a robust training signal and is less susceptible to reward hacking, making it a promising approach for improving the performance of LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OdysseyArena, a framework for evaluating autonomous agents' ability to discover latent transition laws and exhibit long-horizon foresight, revealing a critical bottleneck in current Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of LLMs has led to the development of autonomous agents, but existing evaluations neglect the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws autonomously, hindering agentic foresight and strategic coherence.

Method: The authors formalize and instantiate four primitives to translate abstract transition dynamics into interactive environments, establishing OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking and OdysseyArena-Challenge for stress-testing agent stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in autonomous discovery in complex environments.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for improved inductive capabilities in LLMs to achieve autonomous discovery and foresight, and provides a framework for evaluating and benchmarking these abilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method for large language models, achieving efficient global pattern discovery and reducing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in large language models poses a critical bottleneck, and existing dynamic sparse attention methods face trade-offs.

Method: RRAttention employs a head round-robin sampling strategy, rotating query sampling positions across attention heads, and uses adaptive Top-τ selection for optimal sparsity.

Result: RRAttention reduces complexity from O(L^2) to O(L^2/S^2), recovers over 99% of full attention performance, and achieves 2.4× speedup at 128K context length.

Conclusion: RRAttention outperforms existing dynamic sparse attention methods and achieves efficient global pattern discovery while maintaining query independence.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework for hate speech detection that improves cross-dataset robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection is a complex task that is often oversimplified as a binary classification problem, leading to models that are not robust under domain shift and annotation noise.

Method: The authors decompose hate speech detection into a checklist of concept-level questions answered by a large language model, and then aggregate the diagnostic signals using a lightweight decision tree.

Result: The proposed framework consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift, and provides fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.

Conclusion: Reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

TL;DR: FaithRL: A reinforcement learning method to reduce hallucinations in small reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address faithfulness hallucinations in small reasoning models (SRMs) that are crucial for chain-of-thought reasoning in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL) with step-level supervision and an implicit truncated resampling strategy.

Result: FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the chain-of-thought and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: FaithRL is an effective method for mitigating faithfulness hallucinations in SRMs, improving the reliability of their reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces KV-CoRE, an SVD-based method for quantifying the compressibility of kv-caches in large language models, and analyzes the compressibility across models, datasets, and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address the memory bandwidth saturation issue caused by the growing context length in large language models, and the neglect of data-dependent nature of kv-caches in existing KV-cache compression approaches.

Method: The authors propose KV-CoRE, a gradient-free and incremental SVD-based method, to quantify the low-rank compressibility of kv-caches, and employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility.

Result: The study uncovers systematic patterns linking compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage, and shows that compressibility correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a principled evaluation framework and a large-scale benchmark for kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

*Léo Labat,Etienne Ollion,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether multilingual large language models (LLMs) behave consistently across languages when responding to value-laden multiple-choice questions (MCQs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effect of multilingualism on LLM factual recall has been studied, but the impact of language on value-laden MCQ responses is less explored.

Method: The authors created a new corpus called Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS) with human-translated survey questions in 8 European languages. They administered a subset of these questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs under controlled prompt variations.

Result: The results show that larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, but their responses vary across questions. Language-specific behavior is observed in consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions.

Conclusion: The study suggests that multilingual LLMs do not behave like theoretical polyglots, and their responses to value-laden MCQs depend on the language of the question. Further study is needed to understand the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

Motivation: Long reasoning models struggle in multilingual settings due to limited abilities for multilingual question understanding and reasoning.

Method: TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates translation training into multilingual reasoning.

Result: Outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points on MMATH, improving answer correctness and language consistency, and enhances translation quality.

Conclusion: TRIT effectively addresses the challenges of multilingual question understanding and reasoning, leading to improved performance and translation quality.

Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for analyzing semantic representations as navigation through embedding space and applies it to various datasets across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how humans traverse the geometry of semantic representations, the authors introduced a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space.

Method: The authors constructed participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extracted geometric and dynamical metrics using different transformer text embedding models.

Result: The approach distinguished between clinical groups and concept types, and comparison with a non-cumulative approach revealed that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories.

Conclusion: The study provides a mathematical framework for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB) and DSB Cache to improve the efficiency and quality of diffusion large language models (dLLMs) for text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the suboptimality of the widely-used fixed block schedule in dLLMs, which can lead to premature commitments to uncertain positions and delayed processing of easy positions.

Method: The authors propose DSB, a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size, and DSB Cache, a KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB.

Result: The proposed methods consistently improve both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs across multiple models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Dynamic Sliding Block and DSB Cache methods offer a reliable and efficient solution for dLLMs, overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed block scheduling.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.

TL;DR: This study examines the factors affecting the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) in assessing mental health conditions, finding that contextual knowledge and modeling strategies are crucial for accurate assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited knowledge on what factors affect the accuracy of LLMs in assessing mental health conditions in a zero-shot fashion.

Method: The study evaluated 11 state-of-the-art LLMs using a clinical dataset of 1,437 individuals, varying contextual knowledge and modeling strategies to assess their impact on accuracy.

Result: The findings indicate that LLMs are most accurate with detailed construct definitions and context, increased reasoning effort, and ensembling a supervised model with zero-shot LLMs.

Conclusion: The choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) to accurately assess mental health conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.

### [160] [Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06025)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for Large Language Model (LLM) agents, enabling explicit control over performance-cost trade-offs in memory construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing LLM systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction, which can be inefficient and may discard critical information. Prior runtime memory utilization approaches incur substantial overhead and offer limited control over the performance-cost trade-off.

Method: BudgetMem structures memory processing into modules with three budget tiers (Low, Mid, High) and uses a lightweight router to balance task performance and memory construction cost, implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning.

Result: BudgetMem outperforms strong baselines when prioritizing performance (high-budget setting) and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed BudgetMem framework achieves a favorable performance-cost trade-off in LLM memory construction, with analysis clarifying the strengths and weaknesses of different budget tiering strategies under varying budget regimes.

Abstract: Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

### [161] [DFlash: Block Diffusion for Flash Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06036)
*Jian Chen,Yesheng Liang,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFlash is a speculative decoding framework that uses a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting, achieving over 6x lossless acceleration across various models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive large language models have high inference latency and poor GPU utilization due to sequential decoding. Existing speculative decoding methods rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups.

Method: DFlash employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting, generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model.

Result: DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

Conclusion: DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates, mitigating the bottleneck of autoregressive decoding in large language models.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

### [162] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the linear model of AI progress, introducing 'familiar' and 'strange' intelligence concepts, and defends a nonlinear model of intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce new concepts to better understand AI intelligence.

Method: The paper develops and defends a nonlinear model of intelligence, analyzing the implications for evaluating AI capacities.

Result: The authors conclude that if AI is 'strange intelligence', even capable systems may fail in obvious tasks, and excellent performance in one task domain does not guarantee broad capacities.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that a nonlinear model of intelligence is more appropriate for understanding AI, and that traditional evaluation methods may be insufficient.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

### [163] [DeepRead: Document Structure-Aware Reasoning to Enhance Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05014)
*Zhanli Li,Huiwen Tian,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepRead, a structure-aware multi-turn document reasoning agent for long-document question answering, leveraging document-native priors and achieving significant improvements over existing agentic search frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs) has led to the evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from one-shot, passive retrieval to multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. However, existing agentic search frameworks underutilize document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure.

Method: DeepRead is introduced, which operationalizes document-native priors by converting PDFs into structured Markdown, indexing documents at the paragraph level, and assigning metadata keys. It equips the LLM with Retrieve and ReadSection tools for localized and contiguous reading.

Result: DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering, validating the synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools. Fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a human-like 'locate then read' reading and reasoning paradigm.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DeepRead effectively leverages document-native priors for improved long-document question answering, demonstrating a more human-like approach to document reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

### [164] [MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048)
*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) for AI agents to elicit human inputs in object-driven planning, achieving near-expert returns with limited questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of joint planning in human-AI teaming with incomplete information and knowledge gaps.

Method: The authors propose MINT, a neuro-symbolic approach that builds a symbolic tree and leverages self-play to optimize AI agent's elicitation strategies, and utilize LLM to summarize and curate queries.

Result: MINT-based planning achieves near-expert returns, improved rewards, and success rates on three benchmarks with unseen/unknown objects.

Conclusion: The proposed MINT approach effectively bridges knowledge gaps in joint planning, enabling AI agents to elicit necessary human inputs for optimal planning performance.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

### [165] [Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05059)
*Adithya Kulkarni,Mohna Chakraborty,Jay Bagga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines the performance of a Large Language Model (LLM) on graph theoretic problems, finding it reliable for established material but limited for novel insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs support mathematically rigorous thinking in computer science education, particularly in graph theory.

Method: An eight-stage evaluation protocol was used, involving interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction on two graph theoretic problems.

Result: The LLM performed well on a solved problem but did not advance toward a solution for an open problem, acknowledging uncertainty instead of fabricating results.

Conclusion: LLMs can support exploration of established material but are limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning, highlighting the need for guided use in computing education.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models (LLMs) and proposes a new framework for agent UQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to shift UQ research from single-turn question-answering to realistic settings with interactive agents.

Method: The paper presents a general formulation of agent UQ and proposes a novel perspective of conditional uncertainty reduction process.

Result: The result is a conceptual framework for designing UQ in LLM agent setups.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the practical implications of agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Gunther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

TL;DR: This study presents a reinforcement learning-based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions using small satellites, optimizing spacecraft rendezvous operations and reducing collision risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing crowding of Earth's orbital environment with debris poses significant challenges for ADR missions, necessitating the development of adaptive collision avoidance strategies.

Method: The proposed framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance using a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions.

Result: Simulated ADR scenarios using the Iridium 33 debris dataset demonstrate that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study validates the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in mental health by comparing clinician and LLM judge ratings of simulated conversations between AI chatbots and user-agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI chatbots for psychological support raises concerns about their safety, particularly in detecting and responding to suicide risk.

Method: The study simulated conversations between LLM-based user-agents and AI chatbots, which were then rated by clinicians and an LLM judge using a scoring rubric.

Result: The study found strong alignment between clinician consensus and the LLM judge's ratings, establishing the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation.

Conclusion: The findings support the use of VERA-MH as an open-source, automated AI safety evaluation for mental health, with further research needed to address generalizability and robustness.

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

TL;DR: This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit and finds a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration.

Method: Three planners (nominal Masked PPO, domain-randomized Masked PPO, and plain Monte Carlo Tree Search) are compared in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in different scenarios.

Result: Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time.

Conclusion: The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance.

Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments.

GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured multi-evaluator framework to assess the reliability and bias of LLMs in payment-risk settings, revealing substantial heterogeneity among models and highlighting the need for bias-aware protocols in financial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the reliability and bias of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators of reasoning quality in payments-risk settings, particularly in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment.

Method: The authors introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. They use five frontier LLMs to generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions.

Result: The results reveal substantial heterogeneity among LLMs, with some showing negative self-evaluation bias and others displaying positive bias. Evaluation by payment-industry experts and ground-truth validation using payment-network data confirm that the framework captures genuine quality and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

### [172] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Democratic Preference Optimization (DemPO), a framework that applies algorithmic sortition to preference-based fine-tuning of AI systems, ensuring demographic representativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the issue that current AI alignment methods, such as RLHF, rely on human raters who are typically not demographically representative.

Method: The authors propose two training schemes: Hard Panel, which trains exclusively on preferences from a quota-satisfying mini-public sampled via sortition, and Soft Panel, which retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery.

Result: The results show that Hard Panel consistently ranks first, and Soft Panel outperforms the unweighted baseline across six aggregation methods, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases.

Conclusion: The study concludes that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SocialVeil, a social learning environment that simulates social interaction under communication barriers, and evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in such settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in interactive environments assume idealized communication, which limits the ability to diagnose LLMs' performance in realistic, imperfect settings.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, introduced three types of disruption (semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, and emotional interference), and proposed two barrier-aware evaluation metrics (unresolved confusion and mutual understanding).

Result: Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs showed that communication barriers impaired performance, reducing mutual understanding by over 45% and elevating confusion by nearly 50%. Human evaluations validated the fidelity of the simulated barriers.

Conclusion: This work brings social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents, and demonstrates that adaptation strategies have a modest effect on improving performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic prediction is challenging in data-scarce, cross-city settings due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts.

Method: CAST-CKT employs a chaotic analyser, chaos-aware attention, adaptive topology learning, and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment.

Result: CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed CAST-CKT framework improves traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings with theoretical analysis showing improved generalisation bounds.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed HugRAG framework consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics, establishing a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes two methods, DAKS and alignment graph, to improve retrieval-augmented generation in Chinese Tibetan medicine with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of retrieval-augmented generation in domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases, particularly in Chinese Tibetan medicine.

Method: The authors propose two complementary methods: DAKS for KB routing and budgeted retrieval, and an alignment graph for evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification in retrieval-augmented generation for Chinese Tibetan medicine.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

*Guozhi Liu,Weiwei Lin,Tiansheng Huang,Ruichao Mo,Qi Mu,Xiumin Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called Surgery to mitigate the safety risks associated with fine-tuning large language models. It utilizes the attention sink mechanism and sink divergence to identify and suppress attention heads that learn harmful patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address the safety risks associated with fine-tuning large language models, which can lead to harmful behavior.

Method: The authors propose a fine-tuning-stage defense called Surgery, which uses a regularizer to suppress sink divergence and steer attention heads towards the negative sink divergence group.

Result: The results show that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90%, 11.25%, and 9.55% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed Surgery method is effective in mitigating the safety risks associated with fine-tuning large language models.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic task generation method for evaluating embodied agents in unseen 3D environments, highlighting the limitations of current state-of-the-art models in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, making it inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition, using a structured graph representation and a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA).

Result: Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on in-situ tasks reveals significant performance gaps.

Conclusion: The necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments is highlighted by the poor performance of SOTA models on basic perception tasks, lack of 3D interaction awareness, and high sensitivity to task types in reasoning.

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces recos, a new similarity metric that outperforms traditional cosine similarity in capturing semantic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of cosine similarity in capturing nonlinear relationships in semantic spaces.

Method: The authors derive a new upper bound for the dot product and propose recos, a metric that normalizes the dot product by sorted vector components.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models show that recos achieves higher correlation with human judgments on STS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative to cosine similarity for semantic analysis.

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for using LLMs in security management, addressing unreliability and hallucination challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of using LLMs in security management tasks, such as unreliability and tendency to hallucinate.

Method: The framework integrates LLMs in an iterative loop, generating candidate actions, checking consistency, and refining actions through in-context learning.

Result: Experiments on four public datasets show that the framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework allows controlling hallucination risk and establishes a bound on the regret of in-context learning under certain assumptions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

TL;DR: This position paper critiques the concept of 'Universal Foundation Models for Time Series', arguing that monolithic models fail to generalize under distributional drift and proposing a Causal Control Agent paradigm instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that time series data from different domains (e.g., finance, fluid dynamics) have incompatible generative processes, making universal models ineffective.

Method: The paper introduces the 'Autoregressive Blindness Bound' to prove the limitations of history-only models and proposes a Causal Control Agent paradigm that leverages external context and specialized solvers.

Result: The authors conclude that universal models degenerate into 'Generic Filters' that fail to generalize and instead advocate for a control-theoretic approach that prioritizes 'Drift Adaptation Speed'.

Conclusion: The paper calls for a shift in benchmarking from 'Zero-Shot Accuracy' to 'Drift Adaptation Speed' to promote more robust systems.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

*Seongyeub Chu,Jongwoo Kim,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes AMR, a novel framework for MOOC recommendation that models path-specific multiple aspects, achieving fine-grained semantically informed recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOOC recommendation methods suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization, and existing graph-based approaches rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts.

Method: AMR models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath, automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, and derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics, and further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information.

Conclusion: The proposed AMR framework achieves more accurate recommendations than methods relying solely on predefined metapaths, and has the potential to improve MOOC recommendation systems.

Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' negotiation capabilities, a crucial business task requiring strategic reasoning and theory of mind.

Method: Introduced PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark based on realistic MBA negotiation scenarios, to evaluate LLMs' negotiation performance.

Result: GPT-5 achieved AGI-level performance, matching or outperforming human business students, with asymmetric gains from joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding, and revealed novel cross-model heterogeneity in negotiation behaviors.

Conclusion: Frontier language agents are capable of high-stakes economic deployment, but robustness and trustworthiness remain challenges.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with long-horizon planning in interactive environments due to compounding errors in simulating future states.

Method: ProAct uses Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD) for supervised fine-tuning on search-derived trajectories and Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic) as an auxiliary value estimator to refine decision accuracy.

Result: Experiments show ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy in stochastic and deterministic environments, with a 4B parameter model outperforming open-source baselines and rivaling state-of-the-art closed-source models.

Conclusion: ProAct enables LLM agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning, demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments and outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many agentic systems are difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows, and the authors aim to address this issue by synthesizing explicit workflows.

Method: The authors propose AgentXRay, which formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search with a Red-Black Pruning mechanism to navigate the search space.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by introducing a new task, AWR, and a framework, AgentXRay, that produces editable white-box workflows, making black-box agentic systems more interpretable.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information in multi-step decision tasks.

Method: The authors introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks, and evaluate the performance of closed and open models on this benchmark.

Result: The results show that agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases, and that providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override, highlighting the need for improvement in these areas.

Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation in residual binarization, achieving state-of-the-art performance and a significant inference speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance in large language models (LLMs) by improving residual binarization, which is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation.

Method: The authors propose RaBiT, a quantization framework that enforces a residual hierarchy by sequentially deriving each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, and stabilizing the process with a robust initialization.

Result: RaBiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Conclusion: The proposed RaBiT framework redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier, enabling efficient deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in opinion dynamics modeling, which are tailored to incomplete priors and struggle to deeply encode physical priors, the authors aim to synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility.

Method: The authors propose a physics-informed neural framework, OPINN, for opinion dynamics modeling, building upon Neural ODEs and the Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system.

Result: The OPINN framework is evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting.

Conclusion: The OPINN framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

Motivation: The growing number of requests in hospital administration and the limitations of prior work in capturing complex administrative workflows.

Method: Proposing H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation.

Result: H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs.

Conclusion: H-AdminSim serves as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

### [193] [THOR: Inductive Link Prediction over Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05424)
*Weijian Yu,Yuhuan Lu,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes THOR, an inductive link prediction technique for hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs), which learns from relation and entity foundation graphs and outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing link prediction techniques for HKGs are mostly transductive, limiting their generalizability to new vocabularies. The authors aim to develop an inductive technique that can handle previously unseen vocabularies.

Method: The authors introduce relation and entity foundation graphs to model inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs. They then design THOR, which uses two parallel graph encoders and a transformer decoder to learn from these foundation graphs.

Result: THOR outperforms baselines in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets, achieving 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed THOR technique demonstrates the effectiveness of inductive link prediction for HKGs, capturing structural invariance transferable across HKGs. The results show significant improvements over existing techniques, and ablation studies reveal key design factors.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness associated with manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches.

Method: The method involves a collaborative multi-agent framework (InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent) and an intent recycling strategy to enhance data mining efficiency and quality, along with a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy.

Result: The result is that the GUI agent fine-tuned using the mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that M$^2$-Miner is effective in mining high-quality GUI agent data, and the mined data significantly improves GUI agent performance, with the work to be released for community research.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electricity price forecasting is challenging due to price signal volatility and nonlinearity, and traditional models struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies.

Method: The paper evaluates various TSFMs (e.g. Tiny Time Mixers, MOIRAI, MOMENT, TimesFM) against traditional statistical and deep learning models (e.g. ARIMA, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data from Singapore, incorporating exogenous factors where applicable.

Result: TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conditional representation learning methods are sensitive to subspace basis and vulnerable to inter-subspace interference.

Method: The proposed OD-CRL framework integrates Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP) to address these challenges.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in customized clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks with superior generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed OD-CRL framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing conditional representation learning methods and achieves superior performance in various tasks.

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

TL;DR: ALIVE, a hands-free alignment framework, improves reasoning in LLMs by using adversarial learning and instructive verbal feedback, achieving better accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods are limited by scalar rewards that are costly, brittle, and blind to underlying logic, preventing models from developing a deep understanding of reasoning principles.

Method: ALIVE uses adversarial learning with instructive verbal evaluation, unifying problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ALIVE mitigates reward signal limitations, achieving accuracy gains, improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical inference benchmarks.

Conclusion: ALIVE achieves accuracy gains, improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates, indicating a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth and positioning it as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment.

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

TL;DR: Phi-former is a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that models compound-protein interactions by incorporating the biological role of motifs, achieving superior performance and providing interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent deep learning methods for predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) do not always align with chemical realities, as they model CPIs at the atomic level rather than considering molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) as the primary units of biological recognition and binding.

Method: Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that Phi-former accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs.

Conclusion: Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks and provides interpretable model explanations, guiding rational drug design and supporting precision medicine applications.

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SDFP, a training-free and plug-and-play framework, accelerates large language models (LLMs) by building a draft model via layer pruning, achieving 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by autoregressive decoding latency, and existing speculative decoding methods are hindered by the complexity of acquiring and maintaining a draft model.

Method: SDFP constructs a draft model by pruning layers of a given LLM based on Fisher Information Trace (FIT), removing low-impact layers while preserving compatibility with the original model.

Result: SDFP achieves 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup across benchmarks without altering the target model's output distribution.

Conclusion: SDFP enables rapid and deployment-friendly draft construction, supporting low-latency multimedia applications without requiring additional training or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources lack high-quality multimodal datasets for ameloblastoma, hindering AI-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology.

Method: The dataset was created by integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data from case reports. Natural language processing and image preprocessing techniques were employed.

Result: The developed multimodal deep learning model showed significant improvements in variant classification accuracy (46.2% to 65.9%) and abnormal tissue detection F1-score (43.0% to 90.3%).

Conclusion: This work advances patient-specific decision support by providing a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework for ameloblastoma diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Split Personality Training (SPT) to detect misalignment in large language models by fine-tuning a second 'honest persona' to review the main model's responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting misalignment in large language models that may conceal misbehavior during training, as standard auditing techniques are insufficient.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning a second 'honest persona' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation, and then activating the LoRA adapter to review the main model's responses.

Result: SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy in detecting misalignment on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism benchmark, whereas the baseline method reports near 0% accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SPT is effective in revealing latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as fictional biases the compromised model was trained on, thereby improving the detection of misalignment in large language models.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

*Zhengyi Guo,Wenpin Tang,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a conditional diffusion guidance framework for generating samples under hard constraints, with applications in safety-critical scenarios and rare-event simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of soft or reward-based guidance methods in diffusion models, which offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction in safety-critical applications and rare-event simulation.

Method: The authors develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation, and quadratic variation process, and propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms to estimate the conditioning function and its gradient.

Result: The results show that the proposed methods are effective in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples, with non-asymptotic guarantees provided for the conditional sampler in total variation and Wasserstein distances.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods through numerical experiments, providing a reliable framework for conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints.

Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

Conclusion: RGCF-XRec offers a robust and efficient solution for explainable sequential recommendations, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating effective generalization and scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents a test-time self-refinement framework for enhancing geometric reasoning in VLMs, achieving significant IoU improvements without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of improving AI's continuous geometric reasoning capabilities, inspired by how humans solve spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzles.

Method: The authors design a framework that models human cognitive mechanisms for solving Tangram puzzles, incorporating in-context learning and reward-guided feedback loops to iteratively refine predictions.

Result: The proposed test-time self-refinement framework achieves IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning with reward-guided feedback loops to enhance geometric reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving significant improvements in IoU without model retraining.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict individual-level biases and emulate biased human behavior under various contextual factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how LLMs can replicate human biases and the implications for designing bias-aware AI systems.

Method: The authors conducted a human experiment with 1100 participants interacting with a chatbot and then simulated the conditions using LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5.

Result: The results showed that LLMs can reproduce human biases with precision, but notable differences were found between models in emulating human behavior.

Conclusion: The study has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of developing effective NLP systems for low-resource languages due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources.

Method: The paper introduces GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) and two baselines: (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation.

Result: Experimental results show that GETR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 13-27 percentage point improvements in POS tagging, sentiment classification, and NER tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that GETR is effective for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and identifies key factors contributing to successful transfer.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Resin and Reactive Circuits to improve exact inference in complex probabilistic models, achieving significant speedup and reduced latency in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs, particularly for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates.

Method: The authors introduce Resin, a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming, and Reactive Circuits (RCs), a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams.

Result: The proposed RCs successfully capture environmental dynamics, reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning by decomposing large inference tasks into individually memoized sub-problems based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed Resin and Reactive Circuits (RCs) achieve several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference in high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Generative Ontology, a framework that combines the strengths of traditional ontologies and large language models to generate novel artifacts with structural validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ontologies can describe domain structure but lack the ability to generate novel artifacts, while large language models can generate fluently but often produce outputs lacking structural validity.

Method: The framework encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas and uses a multi-agent pipeline with specialized roles to generate novel designs grounded in precedents and validated for coherence.

Result: The framework is demonstrated through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs that satisfy ontological constraints while remaining creative.

Conclusion: The authors argue that constraints, such as those provided by ontology, enable structured generation and creativity, just as grammar makes poetry possible.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an analytical model to accurately characterize the energy efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a function of input and output lengths, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the energy footprint of LLMs, as existing approaches oversimplify energy consumption estimation.

Method: Deriving an analytical model from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, and evaluating energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across diverse LLMs.

Result: The proposed model accurately characterizes the efficiency curve, showing that aligning sequence lengths with 'Sweet Spots' can substantially reduce energy usage.

Conclusion: The findings support informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems, enabling more energy-efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), a more parameter-efficient alternative to standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors find that the basis vectors in LoRA exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions.

Method: GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors, achieving higher parameter efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance across multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: GenLoRA provides a more efficient and effective approach to fine-tuning pretrained models compared to standard LoRA.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Anchored Policy Optimization (APO) to address the Recursive Space Contraction issue in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards. APO improves accuracy and diversity in mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing methods, specifically the Recursive Space Contraction pathology in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards, which leads to an irreversible collapse of valid alternatives.

Method: The method involves defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support and using a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse, thus achieving Support Coverage.

Result: The results show that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods in mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Anchored Policy Optimization serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches, thus improving the performance of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning framework with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification to mitigate hallucinations in financial RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inconsistency between retrieved documents and generated responses in financial RAG systems, which often suffer from hallucinations.

Method: The proposed method, RLFKV, decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units, assesses their correctness, and computes a fine-grained faithful reward. It also incorporates an informativeness reward to prevent overly concise replies.

Result: Experiments on the FDD task and the newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of the RLFKV approach.

Conclusion: The proposed RLFKV framework improves the alignment of generated responses with retrieved documents in financial RAG systems, reducing hallucinations and improving overall performance.

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The authors propose LeakBoost, a framework that improves membership inference attacks by actively probing a model's internal representations, achieving significant improvements in detecting privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems, and existing MIAs have limitations in leveraging dynamic behavior of models.

Method: The authors propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. It synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual objective and is analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector.

Result: LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures, raising AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increasing TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks.

Conclusion: LeakBoost offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

Conclusion: The proposed fully-asynchronous policy training framework effectively addresses the training efficiency bottleneck in VLA models, demonstrating significant throughput improvements and scalability.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Conclusion: The development of FiMI demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specialized language models in achieving significant gains in specific domains while maintaining general capabilities, highlighting the potential for tailored AI solutions in finance.

Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems. We develop two model variants: FiMI Base and FiMI Instruct. FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data. This is followed by instruction fine-tuning and domain-specific supervised fine-tuning focused on multi-turn, tool-driven conversations that model real-world workflows, such as transaction disputes and mandate lifecycle management. Evaluations reveal that FiMI Base achieves a 20% improvement over the Mistral Small 24B Base model on finance reasoning benchmark, while FiMI Instruct outperforms the Mistral Small 24B Instruct model by 87% on domain-specific tool-calling. Moreover, FiMI achieves these significant domain gains while maintaining comparable performance to models of similar size on general benchmarks.

### [218] [NEX: Neuron Explore-Exploit Scoring for Label-Free Chain-of-Thought Selection and Model Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05805)
*Kang Chen,Zhuoka Feng,Sihan Zhao,Kai Xiong,Junjie Nian,Yaoning Wang,Changyi Xiao,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes NEX, a framework for unsupervised scoring in large language models, which effectively ranks candidate responses and predicts downstream accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the shifting bottleneck from generation to selection in large language models, where the lack of supervision on the target distribution hinders the selection process.

Method: The proposed NEX framework views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation), using entropy-based exploration proxies and sparse activation caches to detect E-phase and infer E-X phases.

Result: The results show that NEX successfully predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, with validation through human annotations and causal evidence via neuron transfer.

Conclusion: NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework, effectively ranks candidate responses and merged variants without task answers, predicting downstream accuracy and identifying better variants.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompting strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) are limited by reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints and lack of optimization through dynamic interaction with TKGs environments.

Method: The proposed TKG-Thinker employs a dual-training strategy, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought data and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage with multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art Boolean neural networks, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations on standard vision benchmarks.

Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to alleviate the manual process of seating allocation in large organizations, which is currently suboptimal and infrequently replanned.

Method: The method involves calculating the distance between seats using PRM and RRT, and then using integer programming, heuristic search, and dynamic programming to solve the HSAP.

Result: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different sized instances, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed end-to-end framework can efficiently solve the HSAP, ensuring that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM to address security challenges in LLM-based conversational agents in vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLM-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges, and existing AI security frameworks lack a rigorous 'separation of concerns' standard.

Method: The authors propose a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis, introducing a human-centric asset taxonomy and a formal graph-based model.

Result: The framework's practical applicability is demonstrated through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery.

Conclusion: The proposed AgentHeLLM framework addresses the methodological gap in existing AI security frameworks and provides a rigorous approach to threat modeling for LLM-based conversational agents in vehicles.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

Conclusion: The paper aims to provide comprehensive guidance on using large language models (LLMs) in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows, addressing common issues and emphasizing principled design choices and empirical evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting (GATTF) model to improve motorway traffic forecasting by incorporating geographical relationships between sensors using mutual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management relies on high-resolution real-time traffic data and predicted traffic conditions. However, predicting motorway traffic is challenging due to its spatio-temporal complexity and non-linear nature.

Method: The GATTF model exploits geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information to enhance forecasting accuracy. The model is evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland.

Result: Results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through mutual information enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

Conclusion: The GATTF model improves motorway traffic forecasting by leveraging geographical relationships between sensors, demonstrating the potential for more accurate traffic prediction in digital-twin technology.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents.

Method: AgenticPay models markets with private constraints and product-dependent valuations, using multi-round linguistic negotiation.

Result: Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: AgenticPay establishes a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition in VR studies, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult.

Method: The authors develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies.

Result: The simulator is used to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy and is shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, enabling scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Conclusion: DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.

### [1] [Non-Markov Multi-Round Conversational Image Generation with History-Conditioned MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20911)
*Haochen Zhang,Animesh Sinha,Felix Juefei-Xu,Haoyu Ma,Kunpeng Li,Zhipeng Fan,Meng Dong,Xiaoliang Dai,Tingbo Hou,Peizhao Zhang,Zecheng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of non-Markov conversational image generation, where a model must follow user instructions across multiple rounds, referencing earlier states and entities. It proposes data construction strategies, history-conditioned training, and improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-round consistency and instruction compliance in conversational image generation by addressing the limitations of existing Markov-based approaches.

Method: The paper presents non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching, and techniques for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization.

Result: The results demonstrate substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The work concludes that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields significant improvements in conversational image generation, enabling more coherent and context-aware image editing and personalization.

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

TL;DR: This study proposes a text-guided denoising method for PET images using a pretrained CLIP model and U-Net based denoising model, showing significant improvements in image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET images often suffer from complicated noise, obscuring critical diagnostic information, and the need for a denoising method that can handle a wide range of count levels.

Method: The proposed model utilizes the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model to denoise PET images.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments of PET image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed model shows potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time, indicating a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Lehel Ferenczi,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct low performance pixel artifacts in CT detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for correcting LPP artifacts require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect, and focus solely on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the CT geometry.

Method: The proposed method leverages the intrinsic correlations of LPP between sinogram and image domains through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter.

Conclusion: The solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training and is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-based model trained on prostate biopsy slides to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy, achieving significant prognostic value and generalizability across multiple cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic tools for predicting BCR after radical prostatectomy are imprecise, necessitating the development of more accurate predictive models.

Method: An AI-based model was trained using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort, and its generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts.

Result: The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70 in the external cohorts, and integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value, enabling statistically significant risk stratification and outperforming guideline-based CAPRA-S.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but further studies are needed to critically scrutinize the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

### [5] [BadDet+: Robust Backdoor Attacks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21066)
*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BadDet+, a penalty-based framework for backdoor attacks on object detection, achieving superior synthetic-to-physical transfer and highlighting significant vulnerabilities in object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand the impact of backdoor attacks on object detection, as existing methods have critical weaknesses and lack physical validation.

Method: The authors propose BadDet+, a unified framework for Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA), utilizing a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs.

Result: BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance, and theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty induces attacks without degrading standard inference.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that BadDet+ highlights significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses, providing a reliable and robust backdoor attack framework.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [6] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that mitigates modality bias in Temporal Action Localization (TAL) by preserving vision as the dominant signal and adaptively exploiting language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the modality bias issue in TAL, where existing approaches overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance.

Method: The method involves a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage and dynamically reweights language modality, and a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP on THUMOS14.

Conclusion: The proposed ActionVLM framework alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning in TAL.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework for multimodal models to improve compositional structural constraints in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation are brittle under compositional structural constraints, such as generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations.

Method: The authors propose SoT, a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections. They train a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states.

Result: Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%.

Conclusion: SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

*Yan Meng,Eduardo J. Torres-Rodríguez,Marcelle Altshuler,Nishanth Gowda,Arhum Naeem,Recai Yilmaz,Omar Arnaout,Daniel A. Donoho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI framework for automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills, achieving high precision and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evaluation of microsurgical techniques traditionally relies on subjective judgment of expert raters, which is limited by inter-rater variability, lack of standardized criteria, cognitive bias, and time-intensive manual review.

Method: The proposed AI framework integrates four core components: instrument detection, tracking, tip localization, and supervised classification.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an instrument detection precision of 97% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%.

Conclusion: The proposed AI framework provides an objective, reliable, and automated system for assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

### [9] [Bidirectional Cross-Perception for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21159)
*Jianzheng Wang,Huan Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework (SDCI) for training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in high-resolution remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing training-free OVSS methods, which struggle with geometric localization and semantic prediction in high-resolution remote sensing imagery.

Method: The proposed SDCI framework introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module, and a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism.

Result: Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that SDCI achieves better performance than existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed SDCI framework effectively addresses the challenges of OVSS in high-resolution remote sensing imagery, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of leveraging superpixel structures within deep learning frameworks.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field imaging.

Method: GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: a modified U-Net architecture, a geometry-guided loss function, and an optimized sampling strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiff-LF outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance.

Conclusion: GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes and advances the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging.

### [11] [Generative Recall, Dense Reranking: Learning Multi-View Semantic IDs for Efficient Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21193)
*Zecheng Zhao,Zhi Chen,Zi Huang,Shazia Sadiq,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR) method to improve Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) by enhancing the recall model with multiple semantic IDs and a shared codebook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of two-stage Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) by enhancing the recall model, as the reranking model's performance is bounded by the recall model.

Method: The GRDR method assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook.

Result: Experiments on TVR benchmarks show that GRDR achieves comparable accuracy to strong dense retrievers while significantly reducing index storage and accelerating retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed GRDR method matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300 times in full-corpus retrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges faced by large vision-language models in robotics, such as confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and overlooking information in video endings.

Method: The method involves constructing a large-scale dataset for robotic perception and reasoning, and introducing an approach that enhances video comprehension by using key frames and full video sequences.

Result: The result is that Thinker achieves state-of-the-art results on two commonly used benchmark datasets in task planning.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Thinker effectively addresses the challenges faced by large vision-language models in robotics, demonstrating its potential for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

*Alvi Md Ishmam,Najibul Haque Sarker,Zaber Ibn Abdul Hakim,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LAMP, a black-box method for generating universal adversarial perturbations targeting multi-image Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored, and existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios.

Method: LAMP applies an attention-based constraint, introduces a cross-image contagious constraint, and uses an index-attention suppression loss to enable a robust position-invariant attack.

Result: Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Conclusion: LAMP is an effective black-box method for generating universal adversarial perturbations targeting multi-image MLLMs, outperforming existing methods and achieving high attack success rates.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

*Xuewen Liu,Zhikai Li,Jing Zhang,Mengjuan Chen,Qingyi Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization framework for AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models, addressing challenges in quantization and achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the underexplored area of applying quantization to ARVG models and to overcome the limitations of existing quantization methods.

Method: The proposed PTQ4ARVG framework consists of three components: Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS), Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ), and Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC).

Result: Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize ARVG models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PTQ4ARVG is a viable solution for quantizing ARVG models, addressing the identified challenges and achieving good performance.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS) method to improve the fidelity-perception trade-off in Plug-and-Play (PnP) image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual quality in PnP methods, which often suffer from reduced data fidelity due to noise introduced during reverse diffusion.

Method: The proposed method, NFCDS, uses a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise, employing a Fourier-domain filter to suppress low-frequency noise and preserve high-frequency content.

Result: The results show that NFCDS improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks, enabling fast convergence to high-fidelity and perceptually convincing results without additional training.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that NFCDS can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks as a PnP module, improving the fidelity-perception trade-off in image restoration tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

*Esteban Rodríguez-Betancourt,Edgar Casasola-Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hypersolid, a method to prevent representation collapse in self-supervised learning by treating representation learning as a discrete packing problem and using short-range hard-ball repulsion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing representation collapse in self-supervised learning.

Method: Hypersolid uses short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions, resulting in a high-separation geometric regime.

Result: Hypersolid excels on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks by preserving augmentation diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed Hypersolid method effectively prevents representation collapse and achieves good performance on specific classification tasks.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates, as traditional 2D video compression techniques and implicit neural rendering methods have limitations.

Method: The proposed framework integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering, transmitting only essential facial metadata and utilizing a Gaussian-based head model for efficient reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates.

Conclusion: The proposed method is well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications, achieving high-fidelity and low-bitrate 3D talking face compression.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

*Mohit Talreja,Joshua Diao,Jim Thannikary James,Radu Casapu,Tejas Santanam,Ethan Mendes,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains, evaluating VLMs' ability to explain their location predictions, and finds a gap between human experts and VLMs in producing auditable reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of explainability in VLMs' geolocation predictions, despite their high accuracy, by introducing a benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains.

Method: The authors collaborated with expert GeoGuessr players to create a benchmark of 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes, evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies.

Result: The results show that large, closed-source VLMs like Gemini and GPT-5 perform well in location prediction but struggle with producing auditable reasoning chains, while open weights VLMs like Llama and Qwen fail catastrophically.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while large VLMs rival human experts in predicting locations, they lag behind in producing auditable reasoning chains, highlighting VLM limitations in extracting fine-grained visual attributes.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for antenna affiliation identification in communication networks using multi-modal classification and matching tasks, achieving significant performance gains through a dedicated training framework and Token Entropy Regularization module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of manual tower inspections for antenna affiliation identification, which is cumbersome and error-prone.

Method: The proposed method involves fusing video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, and utilizes a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals, along with a Token Entropy Regularization module.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed Token Entropy Regularization module accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains, and further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a novel paradigm shift for antenna affiliation identification, achieving improved performance through the proposed method, and the code will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark for evaluating physical fidelity of generative foundational models, revealing limitations in current state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing physics-based video benchmarks in evaluating generative foundational models, particularly their inability to assess physical concepts in isolation.

Method: Designed WorldBench with two levels of evaluation: intuitive physical understanding and low-level physical constants/material properties, allowing for concept-specific assessment.

Result: State-of-the-art video-based world models demonstrated specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts and lacked physical consistency for reliable real-world interactions.

Conclusion: WorldBench provides a more nuanced and scalable framework for evaluating physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, enabling more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively handle the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks, which remains a significant challenge for depth completion tasks.

Method: The proposed GBPN framework dynamically constructs a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) using the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN) and infers it via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution.

Result: GBPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks and demonstrates superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets.

Conclusion: The GBPN framework successfully addresses the challenge of handling sparse and irregular input depth data, providing a robust and generalizable solution for depth completion tasks.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for apple leaf disease classification, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance with extremely low parameter count, making it suitable for deployment on low-resource platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the global population and technological advancement have intensified the demand for food production, and minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases is crucial. Apples are among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits, but diseases account for substantial production losses.

Method: The authors propose Mam-App, a Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. They evaluate the model on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease, Corn Leaf Disease, and Potato Leaf Disease datasets.

Result: Mam-App achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the Apple Leaf Disease dataset with 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and 99.22% F1-score, using only 0.051M parameters. It also performs well on the Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Mam-App model offers a trade-off between efficiency and performance, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance with a significantly low parameter count, making it suitable for deployment on low-resource platforms such as drones and mobile devices.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

TL;DR: Introduces Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE) for high-quality 3D mesh generation, achieving 6x improvement in maximum generatable sequence length and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D mesh generation suffer from insufficient resource utilization, slow inference, and limited ability to handle large sequences, constraining expressible structural details.

Method: Proposes LANE, which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies, and Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy for spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process.

Result: LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency.

Conclusion: LANE provides an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation, overcoming the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to mitigate overconfidence in deep neural networks on out-of-distribution inputs by leveraging the geometry of optimal transport-induced singular boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions.

Method: The authors formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, identify the resulting singular boundaries, and construct a class of OOD inputs (OTIS) by sampling near these boundaries. A confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS during training to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence in deep neural networks by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries, resulting in more calibrated and reliable predictions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models can learn continuous disease progression from static images, and their representations can be evaluated using trajectory fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to investigate whether vision foundation models' representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data, particularly in computational pathology.

Method: The authors used diffusion pseudotime to probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space.

Result: The results showed that pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities. Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of spectral inconsistency across bands in HSI-SR methods, which often leads to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts.

Method: The authors introduce a novel enhance-then-rectify pipeline, consisting of Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) and Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR), along with a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, SR$^{2}$-Net, to enhance spectral fidelity in HSI-SR models, achieving consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) for Class-Incremental Learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance by constructing a robust global adapter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of maintaining task-specific parameters and naive parameter fusion in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), which hinder knowledge transfer and lead to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The authors propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter, utilizing a fusion mechanism derived from the PAC-Bayes theorem and a Robust Initialization strategy.

Result: Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple CIL benchmarks.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method called Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS) for Class-Incremental Learning, which guides the activation space through targeted sparsification to promote knowledge transfer and prevent inter-task interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper argues that existing parameter-constraining methods for preventing inter-task interference in Class-Incremental Learning are detrimental to plasticity, and thus proposes SGDS to address this issue.

Method: SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace and prevents interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes through targeted sparsification.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

Conclusion: SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space, achieving state-of-the-art performance in Class-Incremental Learning.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

*Kailash A. Hambarde,Hugo Proença*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT) to address the challenge of aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) under extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that existing AG-ReID methods implicitly assume that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations, which is not the case.

Method: The proposed GIQT is a lightweight low-rank module that rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry, and is combined with a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism.

Result: Experiments on four AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed GIQT framework effectively addresses the challenge of AG-ReID under extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies, and shows improved robustness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the utilization of generation to improve understanding in UMMs, as previous methods have only leveraged understanding to enhance generation.

Result: The results show that UniMRG enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while also boosting generation capabilities across diverse UMM architectures.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that UniMRG is a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method that improves the understanding capabilities of UMMs.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical dual-path framework to detect AI-generated videos by analyzing 'Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF) in the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of video generation models has made it challenging to distinguish between real and high-fidelity fake videos. The authors argue that AI-generated videos exhibit a structured and homogenous characteristic in the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames, termed 'Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF).

Method: The proposed framework consists of two branches: the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, which captures residual spatial anomalies or physical violations using Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), and the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch, which analyzes the structured MPF in visually perfect sequences.

Result: The framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical dual-path framework effectively detects AI-generated videos by leveraging the characteristics of MPF, providing a robust solution for distinguishing between real and high-fidelity fake videos.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

TL;DR: This study identifies the limitations of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in dense, self-occluding scenes and proposes an explicit geometric pipeline to overcome these limitations, achieving improved instance recovery rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to understand the reliability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes and to overcome the limitations of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion.

Method: The study uses controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion to demonstrate the limitations of state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs and introduces an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) initialized from SfM feature geometry.

Result: The results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes, with the proposed SVRaster approach achieving a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters and being more robust to supervision failure.

Conclusion: The study identifies a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, termed Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD), and proposes an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) to overcome this limitation, achieving a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The efficiency of long-video inference is a critical bottleneck due to dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), and existing methods have limited acceleration or degraded performance.

Method: The Spava framework uses sequence-parallel processing with optimized attention, load balancing, and fused forward passes to accelerate long-video inference.

Result: Spava achieves speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, respectively, without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: The proposed Spava framework accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs, delivering significant speedups without notable performance loss.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the effects of different loss functions on metric learning for image retrieval, revealing a trade-off between efficiency and granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of different loss functions on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics in metric learning.

Method: Introducing a diagnostic framework (VARIANCE and GREEDINESS) to compare seven representative losses across five image-retrieval datasets.

Result: Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, while Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings quickly, and N-pair achieves a large mean separation with uneven spacing.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals an efficiency-granularity trade-off, providing practical guidance on choosing loss functions based on the importance of diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of localized and intermittent deepfakes that require fine-grained temporal localization, and the prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods necessary.

Method: The proposed RT-DeepLoc framework uses a Masked Autoencoder trained on authentic data to learn spatiotemporal patterns and produce reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, and introduces Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss to establish a stable decision boundary.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Conclusion: The proposed RT-DeepLoc framework effectively identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors and achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat image generation and editing separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence. The lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements is a major obstacle.

Method: The authors propose SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, combining token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGraph outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, ensuring high-quality and consistent results.

Conclusion: The proposed SimGraph framework addresses the challenges of image generation and editing by providing precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have raised concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows due to their ability to generate realistic crash-like imagery, challenging the boundary between authentic and synthetic data.

Method: HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation, using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline.

Result: HERS achieves consistent improvements across four diffusion backbones, with a 5.5 percent increase in text faithfulness and a 2.3 percent increase in human preference ratings compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed HERS framework improves the fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images, reducing the risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation in automated insurance workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving competitive accuracy with linear complexity on ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of attention mechanisms in modern vision backbones, including their quadratic complexity and difficulty in interpreting attention weights.

Method: The authors propose ViK, which employs MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a token mixer that combines patch-wise nonlinear transform, axis-wise separable mixing, and low-rank global mapping.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that KAN-based token mixing is a potential efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Flow Matching models suffer from latency due to iterative ODE solving. Training-free solvers perform poorly at low NFEs, while training-based methods are costly and lack versatility.

Method: BA-solver introduces a lightweight SideNet alongside a frozen backbone, utilizing Bidirectional Temporal Perception and Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities.

Result: BA-solver achieves comparable generation quality to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs on ImageNet-256^2, with negligible training costs.

Conclusion: BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error, ensuring seamless integration with existing generative pipelines and facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

Conclusion: The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM) achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Motivation: Existing watermark evaluation methods have significant limitations, including lack of a unified framework, lack of interpretability, and inappropriate metrics.

Method: The authors introduce a three-stage training strategy to enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation.

Result: Experiments show that WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Conclusion: The proposed WMVLM framework addresses the gaps in existing watermark evaluation methods and provides a comprehensive and interpretable evaluation for diffusion model image watermarking.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Conclusion: PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

### [46] [Similarity of Processing Steps in Vision Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21621)
*Matéo Mahaut,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies how different vision models converge to similar representations and investigates the intermediate steps and operations that lead to this convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent literature suggests that larger models tend to converge to similar representations despite differences in training objectives, datasets, or modalities, prompting the need to understand the processes leading to this convergence.

Method: The authors quantify the distance between different model representations at various stages, analyzing the evolution of distances between models throughout processing to identify the most different processing steps.

Result: The study finds that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, significant differences remain, with classifier models discarding information about low-level image statistics and CNN- and transformer-based models behaving differently.

Conclusion: The distinctions identified in the study clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, enabling a more qualitative understanding of the underlying processes in image models.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

### [47] [A Tilted Seesaw: Revisiting Autoencoder Trade-off for Controllable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21633)
*Pu Cao,Yiyang Ma,Feng Zhou,Xuedan Yin,Qing Song,Lu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and generation-friendly latent space in autoencoders for latent diffusion models, finding that gFID-dominant preference can be risky for controllable diffusion and that reconstruction fidelity is a better indicator of controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and generation-friendly latent space in autoencoders, and investigate why this bias can be problematic for controllable diffusion.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the bias toward gFID-dominant preference, empirically validate its impact on controllability using several recent ImageNet AEs, and conduct ControlNet experiments to confirm their findings.

Result: The results show that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned, and that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID.

Conclusion: The paper exposes a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.

Abstract: In latent diffusion models, the autoencoder (AE) is typically expected to balance two capabilities: faithful reconstruction and a generation-friendly latent space (e.g., low gFID). In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.

*Shiqi Huang,Shuting He,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework (RSGround-R1) to enhance spatial understanding in Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes pose unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning, and the descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues.

Method: The proposed framework includes Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data, Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with a positional reward, and a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme.

Result: Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of the proposed model.

Conclusion: The proposed RSGround-R1 framework progressively enhances spatial understanding and achieves stable and robust convergence in RSVG tasks.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) aims to localize target objects in large-scale aerial imagery based on natural language descriptions. Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.

*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Xuanle Zhao,Wenkang Han,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Deyang Jiang,Yilin Cao,Lin Ma,Zhixiong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This technical report proposes OCRVerse, a holistic OCR method that enables unified text-centric and vision-centric OCR, and achieves competitive results across different data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements, neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources. The authors aim to address this limitation by proposing a holistic OCR method that enables unified text-centric and vision-centric OCR.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse, where SFT mixes cross-domain data to establish initial domain knowledge, and RL designs personalized reward strategies for each domain.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types.

Conclusion: The proposed OCRVerse method achieves competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework for depression detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life, and existing deep learning approaches have limitations in feature types, cross-modal interactions, and fusion methods.

Method: The proposed CAF-Mamba framework captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, and dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism for effective multimodal fusion.

Result: Experiments on LMVD and D-Vlog datasets demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed CAF-Mamba framework is effective in depression detection and outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Marcel Dreier,Nora Gourmelon,Dakota Pyles,Thorsten Seehaus,Matthias H. Braun,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot domain adaptation strategy improved the accuracy of glacier calving front delineation in a new study site.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The state-of-the-art model for glacier calving front delineation was found to be insufficiently accurate when applied to a new study site, highlighting the need for domain adaptation.

Method: The authors employed a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporating spatial static prior knowledge, and including summer reference images in the input time series to improve the model's performance.

Result: The delineation error was reduced from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m without any architectural modifications to the model.

Conclusion: The study establishes a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel study sites, enabling calving front monitoring on a global scale.

Abstract: During benchmarking, the state-of-the-art model for glacier calving front delineation achieves near-human performance. However, when applied in a real-world setting at a novel study site, its delineation accuracy is insufficient for calving front products intended for further scientific analyses. This site represents an out-of-distribution domain for a model trained solely on the benchmark dataset. By employing a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporating spatial static prior knowledge, and including summer reference images in the input time series, the delineation error is reduced from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m without any architectural modifications. These methodological advancements establish a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel study sites, enabling calving front monitoring on a global scale.

*Zixuan Xia,Hao Wang,Pengcheng Weng,Yanyu Qian,Yangxin Xu,William Dan,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a regularization framework to improve multimodal learning by controlling representation geometry, enhancing both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models often suffer from geometric pathologies like intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, degrading unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework that enforces intra-modal dispersive regularization and inter-modal anchoring regularization on intermediate embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks show consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization framework effectively mitigates modality trade-offs by regulating representation geometry, and is plug-and-play compatible with various training paradigms.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, yet strong optimization alone does not guaranty well-structured representations. Even under carefully balanced training schemes, multimodal models often exhibit geometric pathologies, including intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, which degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.
  We identify representation geometry as a missing control axis in multimodal learning and propose \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework. \regName enforces two complementary constraints on intermediate embeddings: an intra-modal dispersive regularization that promotes representation diversity, and an inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without rigid alignment. The proposed regularizer is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.
  Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.

*Dexuan Ding,Ciyuan Peng,Endrowednes Kuantama,Jingcai Guo,Jia Wu,Jian Yang,Amin Beheshti,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yuankai Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method, MVSC, is proposed to improve Alzheimer's disease classification using 3D sMRI images by compressing them into compact 2D features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sMRI representation learning have limitations, including high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features.

Method: The MVSC method uses a Volume Context Encoder and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module to compress 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, which are then used for AD classification.

Result: MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC) method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Alzheimer's disease classification tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartE$^{3}$, a benchmark for end-to-end chart editing that evaluates models without intermediate representations, and reveals limitations in current multimodal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent, which is of great practical value but difficult due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency.

Method: The authors propose ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision, and contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation.

Result: Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current end-to-end chart editing capabilities have significant limitations, especially for global editing tasks, and introduces ChartE$^{3}$ as a benchmark to evaluate and improve these capabilities.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format for structured data analysis. Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

TL;DR: DreamActor-M2 is a universal animation framework that addresses challenges in character image animation by reimagining motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from suboptimal motion injection strategies and over-reliance on explicit pose priors, hindering generalization to arbitrary characters.

Method: DreamActor-M2 follows a two-stage paradigm: fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space and introducing a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline for pseudo cross-identity training pairs.

Result: DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: DreamActor-M2 is a significant advancement in character image animation, enabling high-fidelity video synthesis with improved generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios.

Abstract: Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a "see-saw", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

*Baoliang Chen,Danni Huang,Hanwei Zhu,Lingyu Zhu,Wei Zhou,Shiqi Wang,Yuming Fang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new metric called Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC) to evaluate Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models, providing a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing and comparing IQA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing global correlation metrics, such as PLCC and SRCC, reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum, and are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets.

Method: The GMC includes a Granularity Modulator that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences to examine local performance variations, and a Distribution Regulator that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC) provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) performance, revealing characteristics invisible to scalar metrics and offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

Abstract: Evaluation of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models has long been dominated by global correlation metrics, such as Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC). While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|Δ$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|Δ$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, to address the 'Granularity Rigidity' problem in Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topological planning methods in VLN-CE suffer from 'Granularity Rigidity', causing over-sampling in simple areas and under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, leading to computational redundancy and increased collision risks.

Method: The proposed DGNav framework introduces a context-aware mechanism with two core innovations: (1) Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy for dynamic graph construction, and (2) Dynamic Graph Transformer for reconstructing graph connectivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav's superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities, achieving an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Conclusion: DGNav effectively addresses the 'Granularity Rigidity' problem, enhancing instruction adherence and navigation performance in VLN-CE tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a "Granularity Rigidity" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling "densification on demand" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

*Borja Carrillo-Perez,Felix Sattler,Angel Bueno Rodriguez,Maurice Stephan,Sarah Barnes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships using synthetic data and a single view at inference, achieving strong reconstruction fidelity and potential for real-time maritime deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve maritime monitoring by enabling efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction of ships from single images, as most existing methods require multi-view supervision, 3D ground truth annotations, or are computationally intensive.

Method: The authors use the Splatter Image network, fine-tune it on synthetic ShapeNet vessels, and refine it with a custom dataset of 3D ships. They also integrate a YOLOv8-based segmentation module and custom preprocessing, followed by postprocessing steps including real-world scaling and georeferenced placement.

Result: The pipeline demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity on synthetic validation data and shows potential for transfer to operational maritime settings on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides an efficient and scalable solution for maritime monitoring, enabling interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations, and paving the way for real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping.

*Junming Huang,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework, outperforming existing models in generating high-fidelity 3D objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D content generation compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 3D content generation remain underexplored.

Method: The proposed CG-MLLM model leverages the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, decoupling disparate modeling needs with Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer and Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer. It integrates a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space.

Result: Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects.

Conclusion: CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset, and develop MMFineReason models that achieve state-of-the-art results, demonstrating parameter efficiency and a 'less is more' phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between open-source and proprietary Vision Language Models (VLMs) by creating a high-quality multimodal reasoning dataset.

Method: The authors establish MMFineReason via a three-stage pipeline: large-scale data collection and standardization, CoT rationale generation, and comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. They then fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason models.

Result: MMFineReason models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class, with MMFineReason-4B surpassing Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking and MMFineReason-8B outperforming Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking. A subset of 7% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset.

Conclusion: The authors introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct to develop MMFineReason models that establish new state-of-the-art results. A 'less is more' phenomenon is uncovered through difficulty-aware filtering, and a synergistic effect is revealed where reasoning-oriented data composition boosts general capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.

### [61] [Trajectory-Guided Diffusion for Foreground-Preserving Background Generation in Multi-Layer Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21857)
*Taewon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that preserves foreground and maintains stylistic consistency across pages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of foreground preservation and stylistic consistency in background generation for documents, which existing methods struggle with due to the need for explicit constraints or auxiliary mechanisms.

Method: The proposed framework reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space, shaping initial noise and its geometric alignment to avoid foreground regions and introducing cached style directions to constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace.

Result: The method achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency without requiring training or auxiliary mechanisms, producing visually coherent results across complex documents.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, it offers a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling, eliminating the need for repeated style specification and providing a stable foundation for multi-page generation.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the empirical success of CFG in controllable generation, but its sensitivity to the guidance scale, and aims to provide a principled interpretation and improvement of CFG.

Method: The paper analyzes CFG through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, and reformulates CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint, implementing a manifold projection step via incremental gradient descent and enhancing it with Anderson Acceleration.

Conclusion: The paper provides a principled interpretation of Classifier-free guidance (CFG) through optimization, reformulates CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint, and proposes training-free methods to refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Xu Yang,Xuan Chen,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel KV cache policy, PaFu-KV, to improve the efficiency of autoregressive video generation by retaining informative tokens and discarding less relevant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive video generation approaches rely on heuristic KV Cache policies that ignore differences in token importance, leading to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant cache, degrading video generation quality and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV) that introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enabling accelerated inference.

Conclusion: The proposed PaFu-KV cache policy improves the quality-efficiency trade-off in video generation by retaining informative tokens and discarding less relevant ones, enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation.

Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes TraceRouter, a path-level framework to defend against adversarial manipulation of large foundation models (LFMs) by tracing and disconnecting causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses against adversarial manipulation of LFMs rely on the locality hypothesis, which is brittle and detrimental to utility. The authors aim to bridge this gap by proposing a new framework that can effectively defend against adversarial manipulation.

Method: TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) pinpointing a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) leveraging sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) mapping these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

Conclusion: The authors propose a novel framework, TraceRouter, which effectively defends against adversarial manipulation of LFMs by tracing and disconnecting causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.

*Hanmo Chen,Guangtao Lyu,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Xu Yang,Cheng Deng*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for motion-language retrieval focus on global alignment, overlooking fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and text tokens, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The PST framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, learning cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the PST framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed PST framework effectively captures both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships, enabling fine-grained motion-language retrieval.

Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens.

Motivation: To address the underexplored capability of video aesthetic quality assessment in LMMs.

Method: Introduced VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality, and benchmarked 23 open-source and commercial LMMs.

Result: The findings show that current LMMs have limitations in video aesthetics perception.

Conclusion: Current LMMs have basic video aesthetics perception ability, but their performance remains incomplete and imprecise.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully utilizes video diffusion models to improve temporal consistency in zero-shot video restoration and enhancement, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception by extending the concept of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) to deep visual features.

Method: The authors proposed a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and applied it to various vision tasks, including image classification, detection, and instance segmentation.

Result: The results show that FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. Additionally, FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget.

Conclusion: The authors proposed FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map, and validated it across various tasks, showing its effectiveness in controlling feature quality and improving task performance.

Abstract: Deep visual features are increasingly used as the interface in vision systems, motivating the need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget. Our code will be released after publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books.

Method: BookNet uses a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread.

Result: BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification.

Conclusion: The proposed BookNet and datasets (Book3D and Book100) advance the field of document image processing by addressing the unique challenges of book image rectification.

Abstract: Book image rectification presents unique challenges in document image processing due to complex geometric distortions from binding constraints, where left and right pages exhibit distinctly asymmetric curvature patterns. However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other. Moreover, to address the absence of specialized datasets, we present Book3D, a large-scale synthetic dataset for training, and Book100, a comprehensive real-world benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models suppress local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve a mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content.

Method: The authors propose Shallow Alignment, a contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders.

Result: Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones, and enables decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones.

Conclusion: The proposed Shallow Alignment approach effectively addresses the granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, leading to improved neural visual decoding performance and unlocking the scaling law in neural visual decoding.

Abstract: Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.

We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations.

Conclusion: The Drive-JEPA framework achieves state-of-the-art results on NAVSIM, with 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, outperforming prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.

*Da Li,Chen Yao,Tong Mao,Jiacheng Bao,Houjun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel urban neural surface reconstruction (NSR) framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under sparse-view conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NSR methods suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability under sparse-view conditions, which is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing due to limited aerial image acquisition.

Method: The framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction (NSR) has recently shown strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction from multi-view aerial imagery. However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in extending the scaling paradigm to metric depth estimation, which is hindered by heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data.

Method: The authors propose a simple and scalable pretraining framework, Metric Anything, which uses a Sparse Metric Prompt created by randomly masking depth maps to decouple spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases.

Result: The pretrained model excels at various tasks, and its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception.

Abstract: Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at http://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/ to support community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the decomposition of complex data into reusable components and enable the synthesis of new samples via component recombination, particularly in the context of diffusion-based models.

Method: The proposed method introduces an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources, optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator.

Result: The method outperforms prior baselines on various datasets (CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D) with lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC, and demonstrates a novel application to robotic video trajectories.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their method improves both latent factor discovery and the quality of compositional generation, enabling diverse sequence generation for exploration in robotic video trajectories.

Abstract: Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of existing MLLMs in handling complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources, and to improve their performance on tasks requiring extensive factual information.

Method: The proposed Vision-DeepResearch paradigm supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, and internalizes deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training.

Result: The results show that the proposed Vision-DeepResearch substantially outperforms existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation models.

Conclusion: The authors propose a new multimodal deep-research paradigm called Vision-DeepResearch, which performs multi-turn, multi-entity, and multi-scale visual and textual search to improve the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on tasks requiring extensive factual information.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

*Li Zhang,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLO-Inst, a framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives using bi-level optimization, outperforming baselines in general and biomedical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Segment Anything Model's reliance on manual prompts hinders automated deployment, and existing automated pipelines suffer from objective mismatch and alignment overfitting.

Method: The authors propose BLO-Inst, a unified framework that uses bi-level optimization to align detection and segmentation objectives. The lower level fine-tunes SAM to maximize segmentation fidelity, and the upper level updates the detector to minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

Conclusion: BLO-Inst effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing bounding boxes for downstream mask quality, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

Motivation: Existing reference-based image generation methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility.

Method: The authors present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets.

Conclusion: The proposed method opens new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.

Result: ePAI achieved high accuracy in detecting small PDACs, with an AUC of 0.939-0.999 and 0.918-0.945 in internal and external tests, respectively, and detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis.

Conclusion: The study developed an automated system, ePAI, for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using artificial intelligence, achieving high sensitivity and specificity in detecting small PDACs and outperforming radiologists.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, maintaining physical plausibility, and limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors make full-image relighting challenging.

Method: The proposed $π$-Light framework incorporates batch-aware attention, physics-guided neural rendering, physics-inspired losses, and a curated dataset to enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across various materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The $π$-Light framework effectively addresses the challenges in full-image relighting by leveraging physics-inspired diffusion models, providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation.

Abstract: Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VI-Probe, a framework to analyze whether Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perceive visual changes or recall memorized patterns when responding to visual illusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs respond 'correctly' to visual illusions even when illusion factors are inverted, and to investigate whether they perceive visual changes or recall memorized patterns.

Method: The authors developed VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls to measure stability and sensitivity using various metrics.

Result: Experiments revealed that response persistence in VLMs arises from heterogeneous causes, such as memory override, perception-memory competition, and visual-processing limits, depending on the specific model.

Conclusion: The findings challenge single-cause views and suggest that probing-based evaluation is necessary to measure both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change in VLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

### [87] [UEval: A Benchmark for Unified Multimodal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22155)
*Bo Li,Yida Yin,Wenhao Chai,Xingyu Fu,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UEval is a benchmark for evaluating unified models that generate images and text. It consists of 1,000 expert-curated questions and a rubric-based scoring system. Results show that current models struggle, but reasoning models perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate unified models capable of generating both images and text, which is challenging due to the complexity of open-ended multimodal generation.

Method: The authors curated 1,000 expert questions from 8 real-world tasks, requiring both images and text output. A rubric-based scoring system was designed, using multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate initial rubrics, which were then refined and validated by human experts.

Result: The results show that current unified models struggle with UEval, with GPT-5-Thinking scoring 66.4 out of 100 and the best open-source model reaching 49.1. Reasoning models outperformed non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model improved performance.

Conclusion: The UEval benchmark is introduced to evaluate unified models that can generate both images and text. Current models struggle with this task, but reasoning models perform better, suggesting that reasoning is crucial for complex multimodal understanding and generation.

Abstract: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

### [88] [One-step Latent-free Image Generation with Pixel Mean Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22158)
*Yiyang Lu,Susie Lu,Qiao Sun,Hanhong Zhao,Zhicheng Jiang,Xianbang Wang,Tianhong Li,Zhengyang Geng,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'pixel MeanFlow' (pMF) for one-step latent-free image generation, achieving strong results on ImageNet at 256x256 and 512x512 resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance diffusion/flow-based models for image generation by formulating the network output space and loss space separately, enabling one-step generation without latents.

Method: The method involves designing the network target on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (x-prediction) and defining the loss via MeanFlow in the velocity space, with a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field.

Result: pMF achieves 2.22 FID at 256x256 resolution and 2.48 FID at 512x512 resolution on ImageNet, demonstrating strong performance for one-step latent-free generation.

Conclusion: The study advances the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models, filling a key missing piece in the regime of one-step latent-free generation, and is expected to further progress in this area.

Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.

*Nikita Gupta,Riju Chatterjee,Lukas Haas,Connie Tao,Andrew Wang,Chang Liu,Hidekazu Oiwa,Elena Gribovskaya,Jan Ackermann,John Blitzer,Sasha Goldshtein,Dipanjan Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepSearchQA, a benchmark for evaluating agents on complex information-seeking tasks, and highlights the limitations of current state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate agents on complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks and identify performance limitations in current agent designs, driving future research toward more robust capabilities.

Method: The authors designed a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans and generate exhaustive answer lists, testing capabilities such as systematic collation of information, de-duplication, and reasoning about stopping criteria.

Result: The comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations, with models struggling to balance high recall with precision, and distinct failure modes such as premature stopping and hedging behaviors.

Conclusion: The paper introduces DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks, and reveals significant performance limitations in state-of-the-art agent architectures.

Abstract: We introduce DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 different fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes improvements to speech recognition evaluation, including a novel string alignment algorithm and test set, and demonstrates their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve speech recognition evaluation, especially for non-Latin languages with rich word formation, and to address the issue of dataset-specific labeling.

Method: The paper proposes a string alignment algorithm that supports multi-reference labeling and arbitrary-length insertions, and collects a novel test set of longform Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the proposed methods improve speech recognition evaluation and provide tools for evaluating streaming speech recognition and aligning multiple transcriptions.

Conclusion: The paper proposes improvements to speech recognition evaluation, including a string alignment algorithm and a novel test set, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: We propose several improvements to the speech recognition evaluation. First, we propose a string alignment algorithm that supports both multi-reference labeling, arbitrary-length insertions and better word alignment. This is especially useful for non-Latin languages, those with rich word formation, to label cluttered or longform speech. Secondly, we collect a novel test set DiverseSpeech-Ru of longform in-the-wild Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling. We also perform multi-reference relabeling of popular Russian tests set and study fine-tuning dynamics on its corresponding train set. We demonstrate that the model often adopts to dataset-specific labeling, causing an illusion of metric improvement. Based on the improved word alignment, we develop tools to evaluate streaming speech recognition and to align multiple transcriptions to compare them visually. Additionally, we provide uniform wrappers for many offline and streaming speech recognition models. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [91] [Position-invariant Fine-tuning of Speech Enhancement Models with Self-supervised Speech Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21084)
*Amit Meghanani,Thomas Hain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitation of using mean squared error (MSE) loss in fine-tuning self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models with front-end speech enhancement (SE) models, and proposes two strategies to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of SSL-based speech models in noisy conditions by fine-tuning SE models, and to address the limitation of MSE loss in exploiting positional embeddings.

Method: The paper investigates two strategies: (1) zero-padding, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss, to achieve position-invariant fine-tuning.

Result: The results show that the soft-DTW-based approach achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that position-invariant fine-tuning is important in SSL-based speech modelling, and the proposed soft-DTW-based approach is effective in achieving this.

Abstract: Integrating front-end speech enhancement (SE) models with self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models is effective for downstream tasks in noisy conditions. SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss. Experiments show that the soft-DTW-based approach achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance, underscoring the importance of position-invariant fine-tuning in SSL-based speech modelling.

*Ketan Thakkar,Maitreyi Chatterjee,Ramasubramanian Balasubramanian,Achyuthan Jootoo,Rajendra Ugrani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach to fine-tuning large language models, achieving lower latency and memory reduction while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements.

Method: The proposed ChunkWise LoRA partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity, assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration, and introduces a runtime scheduler and boundary-safe composition module.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA while maintaining or improving task performance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have enabled efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with minimal additional parameters. However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity. The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.

*Mingzhi Zhu,Boris Sobolev,Rahul Krishna,Raju Pavuluri,Stacy Patterson,Michele Merler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares data mixing and model merging for creating small, multi-task code LLMs, finding that model merging performs better at larger scales while data mixing is preferred at smaller scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore efficient strategies for multi-task learning in code LLMs that balance performance, constraints, and costs, driven by the interest in deploying smaller, specialized models in agentic frameworks.

Method: The authors conducted extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks, and introduced a weight analysis technique to understand the impact of different tasks on model parameters.

Result: The results show that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scales, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks, while data mixing is preferred at smaller scales. Merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models in some cases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Recent research advocates deploying smaller, specialized code LLMs in agentic frameworks alongside frontier models, sparking interest in efficient strategies for multi-task learning that balance performance, constraints, and costs. We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy. We further introduce a weight analysis technique to understand how different tasks affect model parameters and their implications for merging strategies. The results suggest that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them ideal for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

### [94] [Large Language Models Naively Recover Ethnicity from Individual Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21132)
*Noah Dasanaike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that large language models can accurately infer ethnicity from names, outperforming existing methods and applicable globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research was to demonstrate the capability of large language models to infer ethnicity from names accurately, potentially improving upon existing methods like BISG and enabling applications beyond the United States.

Method: The author used stratified samples from voter files with self-reported race to test LLM-based classification, comparing it to BISG, and further validated the method using various datasets across different countries.

Result: LLM-based classification achieved up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. Including metadata improved accuracy to 86.7%. Validation across various countries showed the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive.

Conclusion: Large language models can infer ethnicity from names with high accuracy, outperforming Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) without additional training data, and can be applied outside the United States to contextually appropriate classification categories.

Abstract: I demonstrate that large language models can infer ethnicity from names with accuracy exceeding that of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) without additional training data, enabling inference outside the United States and to contextually appropriate classification categories. Using stratified samples from Florida and North Carolina voter files with self-reported race, LLM-based classification achieves up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive. For large-scale applications, small transformer models fine-tuned on LLM labels exceed BISG accuracy while enabling local deployment at no cost.

*Noah Dasanaike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnsembleLink, a novel method for record linkage, achieves high accuracy without training labels by leveraging pre-trained language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Record linkage is crucial in empirical social science but is underdeveloped methodologically, with existing methods either having low accuracy or requiring substantial labeled training data.

Method: EnsembleLink uses pre-trained language models to leverage semantic relationships learned from large text corpora, enabling accurate record linkage without labeled training data.

Result: EnsembleLink achieves high accuracy, matching or exceeding methods that require extensive labeling, and can complete typical linkage tasks in minutes on open-source models.

Conclusion: EnsembleLink offers a significant advancement in record linkage by providing a highly accurate method that does not require labeled training data, making it a valuable tool for empirical social science research.

Abstract: Record linkage, the process of matching records that refer to the same entity across datasets, is essential to empirical social science but remains methodologically underdeveloped. Researchers treat it as a preprocessing step, applying ad hoc rules without quantifying the uncertainty that linkage errors introduce into downstream analyses. Existing methods either achieve low accuracy or require substantial labeled training data. I present EnsembleLink, a method that achieves high accuracy without any training labels. EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models that have learned semantic relationships (e.g., that "South Ozone Park" is a neighborhood in "New York City" or that "Lutte ouvriere" refers to the Trotskyist "Workers' Struggle" party) from large text corpora. On benchmarks spanning city names, person names, organizations, multilingual political parties, and bibliographic records, EnsembleLink matches or exceeds methods requiring extensive labeling. The method runs locally on open-source models, requiring no external API calls, and completes typical linkage tasks in minutes.

*Tobias Materzok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Output-Space Search (OS-Search), a method that turns LLM generation into endpoint search, enabling parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in a 3D output space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the diversity and optimization of LLM-generated outputs, such as stories and code, by introducing a new search method.

Method: The proposed OS-Search method involves an outer loop selecting a target in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space, and a retrieval-grounded policy trained with sequence-level RL generates outputs that land near the target under standard autoregressive decoding.

Result: The results show that OS-Search yields 3.1x higher LLM-scored diversity on stories compared to prompt-chaining, and Bayesian optimization over the output space improves an objective on code while preserving validity.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that OS-Search enables efficient parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in the output space, leading to improved diversity and optimization of LLM-generated outputs.

Abstract: We introduce Output-Space Search (OS-Search), which turns LLM generation into endpoint search. An outer loop selects a target z* in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space Z, and a retrieval-grounded policy trained with sequence-level RL generates outputs whose coordinates land near z* under standard autoregressive decoding. This enables parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in Z without path-dependent token/program search. On stories, sweeping Z (text) yields 3.1x higher LLM-scored diversity than prompt-chaining. On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.

*Xiulin Yang,Heidi Getz,Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the statistical distribution of function words affects language acquisition, finding that their high frequency, association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries facilitate acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to understand the statistical conditions that support learning hierarchical structure from linear input, with a focus on the distributional properties of function words in language acquisition.

Method: The authors used cross-linguistic corpus analysis, counterfactual language modeling, ablation experiments, probing, and ablation analyses to investigate the statistical conditions that support learning hierarchical structure from linear input.

Result: The results show that the presence of high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries of function words across 186 languages facilitates language acquisition by neural learners, with frequency and structural association being more significant factors.

Conclusion: The study concludes that language variants preserving high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries of function words are more easily acquired by neural learners.

Abstract: What statistical conditions support learning hierarchical structure from linear input? In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks faced by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis and experiments to identify the critical architectural factors governing the efficacy of embedding scaling.

Result: The result is the introduction of LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model that surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines and exhibits exceptional competitiveness in agentic and coding domains.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that embedding scaling is a potent dimension for scaling sparsity, and when combined with system optimizations and speculative decoding, it can lead to tangible inference speedups.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.

*Eunjung Yeo,Julie M. Liss,Visar Berisha,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework for automated intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of neurological disorders associated with dysarthria necessitates automated intelligibility assessment methods applicable across languages.

Method: The framework integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment, yielding metrics such as phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and phoneme coverage (PhonCov).

Result: Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech, with PER, PFER, and PhonCov benefiting from different aspects of the framework.

Conclusion: The proposed multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework effectively assesses intelligibility in dysarthric speech across multiple languages, capturing language-specific factors and clinically meaningful patterns.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of neurological disorders associated with dysarthria motivates the need for automated intelligibility assessment methods that are applicalbe across languages. However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech.

*Zhaoyi Li,Jiatong Li,Gangwei Jiang,Linqi Song,Defu Lian,Ying Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the failure of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning hop generalization scenarios and proposes a test-time correction method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and address the sharp performance drop in LLMs when the required number of reasoning steps exceeds the training distribution.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, analyzed the internal mechanisms of LLMs, and proposed a lightweight intervention method to dynamically identify and deactivate erroneous processing heads (ep heads).

Result: The proposed test-time correction method consistently improves reasoning hop generalization across different tasks and LLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the internal mechanisms driving the failure of LLMs in reasoning hop generalization scenarios and proposes an effective solution to improve performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has become the standard paradigm for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty and a novel method to build a more honest LLM using pretraining data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of LLMs generating factually incorrect responses due to being unaware of their own knowledge boundary, known as hallucination.

Method: The method involves utilizing Pythia, an open LLM with publicly available pretraining data, to create a robust evaluation benchmark dataset and proposing a novel method to harness the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM.

Result: The result is a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty and a novel method to improve LLM honesty.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that by utilizing pretraining data, LLMs can be made more honest and less prone to hallucination.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable of answering questions, but they are often unaware of their own knowledge boundary, i.e., knowing what they know and what they don't know. As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with "I don't know" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data. In addition, we also propose a novel method for harnessing the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SHARP, a framework for multidimensional evaluation of social harm in large language models, and reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit significant differences in tail exposure and volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of prevailing evaluation benchmarks that reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, obscuring important aspects of risk.

Method: The method involves modeling harm as a multivariate random variable, integrating decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability, and using risk-sensitive distributional statistics, such as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95).

Result: The results show that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility, and that dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that responsible evaluation and governance of large language models require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

Abstract: Advancing beyond single monolithic language models (LMs), recent research increasingly recognizes the importance of model collaboration, where multiple LMs collaborate, compose, and complement each other. Existing research on this topic has mostly been disparate and disconnected, from different research communities, and lacks rigorous comparison. To consolidate existing research and establish model collaboration as a school of thought, we present MoCo: a one-stop Python library of executing, benchmarking, and comparing model collaboration algorithms at scale. MoCo features 26 model collaboration methods, spanning diverse levels of cross-model information exchange such as routing, text, logit, and model parameters. MoCo integrates 25 evaluation datasets spanning reasoning, QA, code, safety, and more, while users could flexibly bring their own data. Extensive experiments with MoCo demonstrate that most collaboration strategies outperform models without collaboration in 61.0% of (model, data) settings on average, with the most effective methods outperforming by up to 25.8%. We further analyze the scaling of model collaboration strategies, the training/inference efficiency of diverse methods, highlight that the collaborative system solves problems where single LMs struggle, and discuss future work in model collaboration, all made possible by MoCo. We envision MoCo as a valuable toolkit to facilitate and turbocharge the quest for an open, modular, decentralized, and collaborative AI future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The substantial storage overhead caused by representing a page with thousands of visual tokens in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VDR limits their practicality.

Result: CausalEmbed achieves a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalEmbed introduces a flexible test-time scaling strategy for multi-vector VDR representations and sheds light on the generative paradigm within multimodal document retrieval.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) through generating high-quality multi-vector embeddings, the substantial storage overhead caused by representing a page with thousands of visual tokens limits their practicality in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time. As a result, CausalEmbed introduces a flexible test-time scaling strategy for multi-vector VDR representations and sheds light on the generative paradigm within multimodal document retrieval.

TL;DR: The report introduces the Qwen3-ASR family, including two speech recognition models and a novel speech forced alignment model, which achieve state-of-the-art performance and offer competitive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop powerful speech recognition models that can handle multiple languages and dialects, and to provide a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model.

Method: The authors leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni, and conduct comprehensive internal evaluation and open-sourced benchmarks.

Result: The 1.7B version achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs, while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: The Qwen3-ASR family models achieve impressive performance and efficiency, and are released under the Apache 2.0 license to accelerate community research in ASR and audio understanding.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new pretraining method using reinforcement learning improves the quality, safety, and factuality of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The critical challenge of ensuring safety, factuality, and overall quality in large language models' generations, especially in real-world applications.

Method: A new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning to improve the next K generated tokens at each step.

Result: The method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements in factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed pretraining method builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up, addressing issues during pretraining rather than relying on post-processing.

Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment is flawed due to the Compliance Paradox, where models prioritize instruction following over objective adjudication, and a novel framework is proposed to expose this vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that instruction following capability in LLMs translates to objective adjudication in educational assessment.

Method: Introduced the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP) to exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap, and evaluated 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in multiple programming languages.

Result: Catastrophic failure rates (>95%) were found in high-capacity open-weights models, which prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness, leading to 'False Certification' of broken code.

Conclusion: Current alignment paradigms create a 'Trojan' vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models prioritize evidence over instruction compliance.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment rests on the unverified assumption that instruction following capability translates directly to objective adjudication. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread "False Certification" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a "Trojan" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic.

*Guy Alt,Eran Hirsch,Serwar Basch,Ido Dagan,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Evidence Ranking, a task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information early in a ranked list for fact verification, and compares one-shot and incremental ranking approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of presenting users with either insufficient or overly redundant information during fact verification, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification.

Method: The authors compare one-shot ranking and incremental ranking approaches, introducing a new evaluation framework and constructing a unified benchmark from existing fact verification datasets.

Result: The results show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, reducing reading effort and improving verification in a user study.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Evidence Ranking is a foundational step toward more interpretable, efficient, and user-aligned information verification systems.

Abstract: Attribution and fact verification are critical challenges in natural language processing for assessing information reliability. While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification. This work provides a foundational step toward more interpretable, efficient, and user-aligned information verification systems.

### [109] [Conversation for Non-verifiable Learning: Self-Evolving LLMs through Meta-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21464)
*Yuan Sui,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play to improve the training of large language models for non-verifiable tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of ground-truth labels for non-verifiable tasks such as creative writing, dialogue, and ethical reasoning makes training large language models challenging. Existing LLM-as-Judge approaches are limited by the quality of the evaluator.

Method: CoNL framework uses multi-agent self-play where multiple agents engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training.

Conclusion: CoNL enables joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play without external judges or ground truth, addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for non-verifiable tasks, such as creative writing, dialogue, and ethical reasoning, remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth labels. While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training.

*Lei Yang,Wei Bi,Chenxi Sun,Renren Jin,Deyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework called SOUP for reinforcement learning in language model post-training, which unifies off- and on-policy learning at the token level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current on-policy RL methods suffer from limited exploration and early saturation due to low sampling diversity, while off-policy data can cause policy mismatch and instability.

Method: The SOUP framework confines off-policy influence to the prefix of a generated sequence sampled from historical policies, while the continuation is generated on-policy, using token-level importance ratios.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOUP consistently outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions, improving both exploration and final performance in LLM RL.

Conclusion: The proposed SOUP framework effectively leverages off-policy information while preserving training stability, and provides a fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training approach for LLM RL.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods widely used for language model post-training, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often suffer from limited exploration and early saturation due to low sampling diversity. While off-policy data can help, current approaches that mix entire trajectories cause significant policy mismatch and instability. In this work, we propose the $\textbf{S}$ingle-sample Mix-p$\textbf{O}$licy $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{P}$aradigm (SOUP), a framework that unifies off- and on-policy learning within individual samples at the token level. It confines off-policy influence to the prefix of a generated sequence sampled from historical policies, while the continuation is generated on-policy. Through token-level importance ratios, SOUP effectively leverages off-policy information while preserving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOUP consistently outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions. Our further analysis clarifies how our fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training can improve both exploration and final performance in LLM RL.

TL;DR: Introduced DimStance, a resource for dimensional stance analysis with valence-arousal annotations across five languages and two domains, and benchmarked models for stance VA prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond categorical stance labels and capture nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, leveraging a dimensional approach from affective science.

Method: Introduced DimStance, a dataset with valence-arousal annotations for 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages and two domains. Formulated the dimensional stance regression task and benchmarked pretrained and large language models.

Result: Results showed competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, but also persistent challenges in low-resource languages and limitations of token-based generation.

Conclusion: DimStance provides a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware stance analysis and benchmarking, enabling fine-grained stance analysis.

Abstract: Stance detection is an established task that classifies an author's attitude toward a specific target into categories such as Favor, Neutral, and Against. Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings. Results show competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, persistent challenges in low-resource languages, and limitations of token-based generation. DimStance provides a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware, stance analysis and benchmarking.

Abstract: Arabic is a linguistically and culturally rich language with a vast vocabulary that spans scientific, religious, and literary domains. Yet, large-scale lexical datasets linking Arabic words to precise definitions remain limited. We present MURAD (Multi-domain Unified Reverse Arabic Dictionary), an open lexical dataset with 96,243 word-definition pairs. The data come from trusted reference works and educational sources. Extraction used a hybrid pipeline integrating direct text parsing, optical character recognition, and automated reconstruction. This ensures accuracy and clarity. Each record aligns a target word with its standardized Arabic definition and metadata that identifies the source domain. The dataset covers terms from linguistics, Islamic studies, mathematics, physics, psychology, and engineering. It supports computational linguistics and lexicographic research. Applications include reverse dictionary modeling, semantic retrieval, and educational tools. By releasing this resource, we aim to advance Arabic natural language processing and promote reproducible research on Arabic lexical semantics.

*Meet Doshi,Aashka Trivedi,Vishwajeet Kumar,Parul Awasthy,Yulong Li,Jaydeep Sen,Radu Florian,Sachindra Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Landmark (LMK) pooling, a new method for representation learning that improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify weaknesses in existing pooling strategies, such as [CLS] and mean pooling, which can under-represent distributed evidence or dilute salient local signals.

Method: The proposed LMK pooling partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings.

Result: Empirical results show that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks.

Conclusion: LMK pooling is a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods, improving long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features.

Abstract: Representation learning is central to many downstream tasks such as search, clustering, classification, and reranking. State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.

TL;DR: This paper proposes inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation, improving data augmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the limitations of existing data augmentation methods, including Mixup and LLM-based methods, and aim to bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space.

Method: The proposed inversedMixup framework adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM, enabling the reconstruction of mixed embeddings into human-interpretable augmented sentences.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of inversedMixup in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios, and provide the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that inversedMixup improves data augmentation performance by combining the strengths of Mixup and LLM-based generation, and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate the manifold intrusion phenomenon.

Abstract: Mixup generates augmented samples by linearly interpolating inputs and labels with a controllable ratio. However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the underexplored area of clinical history taking and the limitations of large language models in dynamic diagnostic settings.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy and a single-turn reasoning paradigm, utilizing a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline to convert medical notes into doctor-patient dialogues.

Result: Experimental results show significant gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o, demonstrating improved clinical reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed method substantially improves clinical reasoning, and the code and dataset are made available on GitHub.

Abstract: Effective clinical history taking is a foundational yet underexplored component of clinical reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems. This design enhances interpretability and enables local supervision, dynamic adaptation, and greater sample efficiency. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves clinical reasoning, achieving gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

Method: The authors propose a fully automated end-to-end framework, ASTRA, which integrates data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning to train tool-augmented language model agents.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that ASTRA is effective in training tool-augmented language model agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance while preserving core reasoning ability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

### [117] [KromHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections with Kronecker-Product Residual Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21579)
*Wuyang Zhou,Yuxuan Gu,Giorgos Iacovides,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KromHC is proposed to improve the scalability and stability of Hyper-Connections in neural networks by parametrizing residual matrices using Kronecker products, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the training instability and restricted scalability of Hyper-Connections in neural networks, and to mitigate the issues faced by existing methods like mHC and mHC-lite.

Method: KromHC uses Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in mHC, enforcing manifold constraints across factor residual matrices.

Result: KromHC achieves exact double stochasticity of residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to O(n^2C), and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art mHC variants in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: KromHC is proposed to address the challenges faced by Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) and mHC-lite, achieving exact double stochasticity of residual matrices with reduced parameter complexity, and outperforming state-of-the-art mHC variants.

Abstract: The success of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks (NN) has also highlighted issues related to its training instability and restricted scalability. The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive $\mathcal{O}(n^3C)$ parameter complexity with $n$ as the width of the residual stream and $C$ as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, $\mathcal{O} \left( nC \cdot n! \right)$. To address both challenges, we propose \textbf{KromHC}, which uses the \underline{Kro}necker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in \underline{mHC}. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

*Abderrahmane Issam,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses language models to study crosslinguistic influence (CLI) in bilingualism, investigating the effects of L1 dominance, L2 proficiency, and pretraining on L1 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inconsistencies in human studies on CLI by using language models as controlled statistical learners.

Method: The authors manipulate L2 age of exposure, L1 language dominance, and L2 language proficiency to study CLI, using cross-linguistic priming to analyze the impact of activating L1 structures on L2 processing.

Result: The results confirm that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI, and provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in language models, showing that L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and influences the neural circuitry recruited for L2.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that language models can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI, providing insights into the underlying drivers of CLI.

Abstract: Despite the centrality of crosslinguistic influence (CLI) to bilingualism research, human studies often yield conflicting results due to inherent experimental variance. We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for controlling Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) using a reference sequence, achieving effective attribute steering with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore effective mechanisms for inference-time control in Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) for text generation, as existing approaches have limitations.

Method: The method involves guiding generation by dynamically aligning internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process, with an optional extension called Spatially Modulated Steering for longer texts.

Result: The results show that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, improving attribute accuracy by 10% to 60% points while maintaining high generation quality.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that ILRR is an effective and efficient framework for steering DLMs, offering flexible control over attributes such as sentiment, and outperforming comparable baselines under the same compute budget.

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a post-training adaptation strategy for subword tokenization methods like Byte-Pair Encoding to improve the performance of large language models on specific domains or languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard approach of using a general-purpose tokenizer can be inefficient for specific domains or languages, as it uniformly processes all textual data.

Method: The proposed algorithm identifies and replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus, effectively encoding the corpus for a given target vocabulary size.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size, serving as a lightweight adaptation mechanism.

Conclusion: The proposed post-training adaptation strategy enables optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks, improving the performance and efficiency of large language models.

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), significantly impact the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs). The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/vijini/Adapt-BPE.git.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory, revealing two distinct dynamical regimes and establishing semantic coherence as a measurable physical property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the underlying dynamics of language progression through a sequence of semantic states.

Method: The authors utilize Allan deviation to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal.

Result: The analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes and finds that large language models exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon compared to human text.

Conclusion: The study establishes semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate human cognition from algorithmic models.

Abstract: While language progresses through a sequence of semantic states, the underlying dynamics of this progression remain elusive. Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Recycling Search Experience (RSE), a self-guided strategy that enhances test-time search for Large Language Models by distilling intermediate conclusions and failure patterns into a shared experience bank, improving efficiency and achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational redundancy in existing test-time search strategies for Large Language Models, which treat rollouts as disposable samples and discard valuable intermediate insights.

Method: The method involves actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, enabling positive recycling of intermediate conclusions and negative recycling of failure patterns.

Result: The results show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency on various benchmarks such as HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that RSE is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of test-time search for Large Language Models, and it achieves state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by allocating additional inference compute to broaden the exploration of the solution space. However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that enables small language models to achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge the trade-off between cost and accuracy in reinforcement learning for multi-turn reasoning agents, particularly for small language models under realistic resource constraints.

Method: DAVID-GRPO stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories.

Result: DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods on six multi-hop QA benchmarks, achieving low training cost with high accuracy for small language model agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on four RTX 3090 GPUs.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that with the right inductive biases, small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints, achieving a balance between low training cost and high accuracy.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has empowered multi-turn reasoning agents with retrieval and tools, existing successes largely depend on extensive on-policy rollouts in high-cost, high-accuracy regimes. Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks. These results show that with the right inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper proposes OG-MAR, a framework that improves cultural alignment and robustness in Large Language Models (LLMs) by utilizing an ontology-guided multi-agent reasoning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the misalignment in LLMs due to skewed pretraining data and the lack of structured value representations, which can lead to inconsistent and uninterpretable outputs.

Method: The proposed method, OG-MAR, constructs a global cultural ontology from the World Values Survey and uses multiple value-persona agents and a judgment agent to enforce ontology consistency and demographic proximity.

Result: Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness across four LLM backbones, producing more transparent reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that OG-MAR is an effective framework for enhancing cultural sensitivity in LLMs by providing a more structured and interpretable approach to value representation and decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a framework that unifies various attention patterns in large language models by analyzing their mathematical formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unifying explanation for diverse attention patterns observed in large language models, which were previously fragmented and lacked a comprehensive understanding.

Method: TAPPA characterizes attention patterns into predictable and unpredictable patterns based on query self-similarity along the temporal dimension, and provides a detailed mathematical analysis of representative cases.

Result: TAPPA deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches, with its insights improving performance in KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TAPPA framework offers a unifying perspective on attention patterns in large language models, leading to improved performance in various tasks.

Abstract: Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-TAPPA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve learning and reasoning efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving or enhancing performance, as existing methods require large-scale reinforcement learning training and often lead to overthinking.

Method: TACLer features tailored curriculum learning and a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Result: TACLer reduces computational cost by over 50% and inference token usage by over 42%, while improving accuracy by over 9% on the base model, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across four math datasets.

Conclusion: TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework, improves learning and reasoning efficiency while preserving or enhancing performance by reducing computational cost and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, especially when equipped with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the robustness of NLP models in assessing sustainability reports, providing a more reliable ESG assessment.

Abstract: Sustainability reports are critical for ESG assessment, yet greenwashing and vague claims often undermine their reliability. Existing NLP models lack robustness to these practices, typically relying on surface-level patterns that generalize poorly. We propose a parameter-efficient framework that structures LLM latent spaces by combining contrastive learning with an ordinal ranking objective to capture graded distinctions between concrete actions and ambiguous claims.

TL;DR: Pretraining language models on procedural data improves performance and accelerates pretraining, showing promise for disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore an alternative to the conventional pretraining paradigm, where models are initially exposed to abstract structured data to ease the acquisition of rich semantic knowledge.

Method: The study involves pretraining language models on procedural data generated by formal languages and simple algorithms, and then evaluating their performance on various tasks.

Result: The results show significant improvements in algorithmic skills, with accuracy jumping from 10 to 98% on context recall when pretraining on Dyck sequences. Front-loading 0.1% procedural data outperforms standard pretraining, and enables models to reach the same loss value with less data.

Conclusion: Procedural pretraining is a simple and effective means to improve language model performance and accelerate pretraining, suggesting the potential for disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Pretraining directly on web-scale corpora is the de facto paradigm for building language models. We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.
  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel contrastive guidance strategy called Temporal Guidance (TeGu) to enhance the generation quality of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational overhead of Contrastive Decoding (CD) and improve the stability of internal self-contrastive decoding methods, particularly on small-scale models.

Method: The method involves leveraging Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast and introducing a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP) to standardize the implementation.

Result: TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead across various model series and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed TeGu method offers a more efficient and effective contrastive guidance strategy for large language models, outperforming existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.

Abstract: Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.

*Alon Rozental*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses the limitations of fixed tokenizers in large language models (LLMs) by providing a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the constraints of fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) that hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data in LLMs.

Method: The method involves a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence decisions, a novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, and a hierarchical diffusion model with Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for reconstruction.

Result: The result shows that Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for detecting harmful memes on social platforms. KID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple multilingual datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to detect harmful content in internet memes, which often rely on metaphors and sociocultural context, making them challenging to moderate.

Method: The authors propose a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose meme understanding into structured reasoning chains, and a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives.

Result: KID achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed KID framework is effective in detecting harmful memes, and the knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning components contribute to its robust and generalizable performance.

Abstract: Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Conversational agents struggle to handle long conversations due to context window limitations. Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-E, a framework for explaining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and reveals that RAG output quality depends on the interplay between its components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of how components in RAG systems interact creates challenges for deployment in high-stakes domains, motivating the need for an explainability framework.

Method: The paper adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP for generator attribution, and proposes the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure retriever-generator alignment.

Result: Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum datasets shows that generators often ignore top-ranked documents and rely on less relevant ones, highlighting the importance of component interplay.

Conclusion: The RAG-E framework enables auditing of RAG systems, demonstrating that output quality depends not solely on individual component performance but on their interplay.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine dense retrievers and language models to ground LLM outputs in retrieved documents. However, the opacity of how these components interact creates challenges for deployment in high-stakes domains. We present RAG-E, an end-to-end explainability framework that quantifies retriever-generator alignment through mathematically grounded attribution methods. Our approach adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP, a Monte Carlo-stabilized Shapley Value approximation, for generator attribution, and introduces the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure how well a generator's document usage aligns with a retriever's ranking. Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant. These failure modes demonstrate that RAG output quality depends not solely on individual component performance but on their interplay, which can be audited via RAG-E.

*Bodong Du,Xuanqi Huang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Distribution-Aware Reward Estimation (DARE) to improve test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of existing TTRL methods that rely on majority voting (MV) to produce deterministic rewards, which can be biased and discard information about non-majority but correct action candidates.

Method: The proposed DARE method shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution, and further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that DARE improves optimization stability and final performance over recent baselines, achieving relative improvements of 25.3% on AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that DARE provides a more informative and robust reward estimation, leading to improved performance in test-time reinforcement learning for large language models.

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) enables large language models (LLMs) to self-improve on unlabeled inputs, but its effectiveness critically depends on how reward signals are estimated without ground-truth supervision. Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation. Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that DARE improves optimization stability and final performance over recent baselines, achieving relative improvements of 25.3% on challenging AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources, especially for geospatial planning problems.

Method: The authors designed MilSCORE, a scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a simulated military planning scenario, and evaluated it using a range of contemporary vision-language models.

Result: The findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning.

Conclusion: MilSCORE is positioned as a challenging testbed for future work on improving large language models' ability to reason over complex, multi-modal information for geospatial planning problems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.

TL;DR: A novel Graph-in-Graph planning framework is proposed to improve embodied agents' long-horizon planning capabilities, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents face challenges in long-horizon planning due to context window limitations and hallucinated transitions, prompting the need for a novel planning framework.

Method: The GiG framework structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture, employing a Graph Neural Network to encode environmental states and introducing a bounded lookahead module for grounded action projection.

Result: The GiG framework achieves Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed GiG planning framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three embodied planning benchmarks, achieving significant Pass@1 performance gains.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability of modern large language models to produce human-like text raises concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, necessitating reliable detection algorithms.

Method: The authors present a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms and introduce a novel algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between original and rewritten text.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in most scenarios, achieving relative improvements of 57.8% to 80.6% across different target LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance, and the proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache is a bottleneck for multi-turn LLM deployment, and existing compression methods fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues.

Method: SONIC compresses historical segments into compact and semantically rich Nexus tokens, and integrates dynamic budget training to adapt to varying memory constraints.

Conclusion: SONIC is effective in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues and enhancing deployment efficiency.

Abstract: The linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache remains a bottleneck for multi-turn LLM deployment. Existing KV cache compression methods often fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues, relying on heuristic eviction that risks losing critical context. We propose \textbf{SONIC}, a learning-based framework that compresses historical segments into compact and semantically rich \textbf{Nexus} tokens. By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining. Experiments show that at compression ratios of 80\% and 50\%, SONIC consistently outperforms baselines such as H2O and StreamingLLM on four diverse multi-turn benchmarks. Specifically, on the widely used MTBench101 benchmark, SONIC achieves an average score improvement of 35.55\% over state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues. Furthermore, SONIC enhances deployment efficiency, accelerating the overall inference process by 50.1\% compared to full-context generation.

TL;DR: This study proposes a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification, using selective fine-tuning of a pretrained decoder-only Transformer, and demonstrates its effectiveness on radiology reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of unstructured clinical narratives in EHRs has created new opportunities for automated disease characterization, but modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging.

Method: The proposed method adapts a pretrained GPT-2 model using a selective fine-tuning strategy, freezing the majority of the backbone and training only the final Transformer block, final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head.

Result: The model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance on radiology reports, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.

Conclusion: Selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: The increasing availability of unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs) has created new opportunities for automated disease characterization, cohort identification, and clinical decision support. However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.
  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.
  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.
  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token-level on-policy distillation methods restrict student model exploration, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from memory bottlenecks.

Method: OVD uses trajectory matching with discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models, avoiding token-level alignment and reducing memory consumption.

Result: OVD outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and +25.7% gain on math benchmarks.

Conclusion: OVD is a memory-efficient framework that enables on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation offers a promising path to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to efficient student models; however, existing token-level on-policy distillation methods require token-level alignment between the student and teacher models, which restricts the student model's exploration ability, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from severe memory bottlenecks in reinforcement learning. We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of hallucinations in LLMs, which generate content inconsistent with the input, and to provide a more efficient and scalable solution compared to existing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF).

Method: The method involves self-checking decoding, internal verification at each reasoning step, latent space evaluation with hallucination risk scoring, and iterative pruning and regeneration to correct detected errors.

Result: Experiments on HALU datasets show that Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable and modular solution for reliable LLM outputs.

Conclusion: Token-Guard is a novel, efficient, and effective method for controlling hallucinations in LLMs, providing a significant improvement over existing decoding-based methods and offering a publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of understanding about the causal origins of interpretable circuits in LLMs during training.

Method: The authors propose a scalable framework called Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA) that utilizes Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples, and conduct experiments on the Pythia family of models.

Result: The results show that targeted intervention on high-influence samples significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, and reveal that repetitive structural data acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Additionally, the authors observe a causal link between induction heads and in-context learning capability.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.

Abstract: While Mechanistic Interpretability has identified interpretable circuits in LLMs, their causal origins in training data remain elusive. We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a structured evaluation approach is necessary for LLM applications, and generic solutions may not be effective, motivating the need for careful evaluation and iteration.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

TL;DR: CARD, a novel framework, unifies training efficiency of ARMs with high-throughput inference of diffusion models, outperforming existing baselines and reducing training latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the training efficiency of ARMs with the high-throughput inference of diffusion models, addressing optimization instability and enabling dynamic parallel decoding.

Method: CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, introducing a soft-tailed masking schema and a context-aware reweighting mechanism.

Result: CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines, reduces training latency by 3 times, and achieves ARM-level data efficiency while enabling parallel generation.

Conclusion: CARD establishes a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs by unifying training efficiency and inference throughput.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Causal Autoregressive Diffusion (CARD), a novel framework that unifies the training efficiency of ARMs with the high-throughput inference of diffusion models. CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, enabling dense, per-token supervision in a single forward pass. To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\times$ compared to block diffusion methods. Our results demonstrate that CARD achieves ARM-level data efficiency while unlocking the latency benefits of parallel generation, establishing a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs.

*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Leviathan, an architecture with a continuous embedding generator, which outperforms standard LLaMA-style architecture in sub-billion-parameter language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper argues that the typical allocation of parameters in sub-billion-parameter language models is suboptimal, particularly the dominance of embedding matrices in the parameter budget.

Method: The authors evaluate Leviathan on the Pile dataset under isoparametric settings and compare it with a standard LLaMA-style architecture.

Result: Leviathan consistently outperforms the standard architecture and exhibits a superior effective parameter capacity, behaving as a dense model with 1.47 to 2.11 times more parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed Leviathan architecture shows improved performance and parameter efficiency compared to traditional models, challenging the conventional allocation of parameters in sub-billion-parameter language models.

Abstract: Transformer scaling law analyses typically treat parameters as interchangeable; an abstraction that accurately predicts loss-compute relationships. Yet, in sub-billion-parameter small language models (SLMs), embedding matrices dominate the parameter budget. This work argues that this allocation is as suboptimal as it is counterintuitive. Leviathan is an architecture with a continuous embedding generator to replace the discrete lookup tables of canonical models. Evaluating on the Pile dataset under isoparametric settings, Leviathan consistently outperforms a standard, LLaMA-style architecture. By means of an empirical power-law fit, Leviathan exhibits a markedly superior effective parameter capacity. Across the regime studied, Leviathan behaves as a dense model with $1.47$ to $2.11 \times$ more parameters.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon that instruction following can interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability and proposes a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify this interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how instruction following affects LLMs' performance and identify potential issues with current alignment strategies.

Method: The authors propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, which measures task performance drop after inserting a self-evident constraint into the instruction. They conduct experiments on various LLMs and tasks, and analyze the results to identify common failure patterns and investigate the mechanisms of interference.

Result: The experiments show that adding self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops in LLMs, even for advanced models. The authors also identify common failure patterns and observe that failed cases allocate more attention to constraints compared to successful ones.

Conclusion: The study reveals a significant issue with instruction following in LLMs and presents a new metric to quantify this interference. The findings have implications for the development of more effective alignment strategies and highlight the need for further research.

Abstract: Instruction following aims to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent by specifying explicit constraints on how tasks should be performed. However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate LLMs' understanding of conversational language, particularly in low-resource languages, as they become increasingly integral to daily life.

Method: The authors introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark.

Result: The results show that LLMs perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context (accuracies above 0.90) but struggle with identifying equivalent English proverbs (best accuracy of 0.79), highlighting limitations in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current LLMs have limitations in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and provides a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages.

Abstract: In recent years, multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an inseparable part of daily life, making it crucial for them to master the rules of conversational language in order to communicate effectively with users. While previous work has evaluated LLMs' understanding of figurative language in high-resource languages, their performance in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system for multimodal reading, which outperforms baselines and GPT-5 on VisDoMBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the brittleness of retrieval-augmented generation in multimodal reading where text, tables, and figures are interleaved across many pages.

Method: The method involves using a Content Graph to preserve document-native structure and cross-modal semantics, and a Planning Graph to track intermediate findings and guide stepwise navigation for evidence completion.

Result: The result shows that $G^2$-Reader with Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct reaches 66.21% average accuracy on VisDoMBench, outperforming strong baselines and a standalone GPT-5 (53.08%).

Conclusion: The conclusion is that $G^2$-Reader effectively addresses the issues of flat chunking and iterative retrieval in multimodal reading, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation is a practical paradigm for question answering over long documents, but it remains brittle for multimodal reading where text, tables, and figures are interleaved across many pages. First, flat chunking breaks document-native structure and cross-modal alignment, yielding semantic fragments that are hard to interpret in isolation. Second, even iterative retrieval can fail in long contexts by looping on partial evidence or drifting into irrelevant sections as noise accumulates, since each step is guided only by the current snippet without a persistent global search state. We introduce $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system, to address both issues. It evolves a Content Graph to preserve document-native structure and cross-modal semantics, and maintains a Planning Graph, an agentic directed acyclic graph of sub-questions, to track intermediate findings and guide stepwise navigation for evidence completion. On VisDoMBench across five multimodal domains, $G^2$-Reader with Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct reaches 66.21\% average accuracy, outperforming strong baselines and a standalone GPT-5 (53.08\%).

TL;DR: VTC-R1 is a new efficient reasoning paradigm that compresses intermediate reasoning segments into images, achieving significant speedup and outperforming standard long-context reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the efficiency bottlenecks introduced by long-context reasoning in large language models, which existing efficient approaches fail to solve without complex additional training or external models.

Method: The authors propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process by rendering intermediate reasoning segments into compact images and feeding them into vision-language models.

Result: VTC-R1 achieves 3.4x token compression and consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning on various benchmarks, including MATH500, AIME25, AMC23, and GPQA-D.

Conclusion: The proposed VTC-R1 paradigm outperforms standard long-context reasoning and improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency.

Abstract: Long-context reasoning has significantly empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, yet it introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the computational complexity. Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fed-MedLoRA, a federated learning framework for adapting large language models (LLMs) to medical applications, addressing limitations in communication overhead and data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable collaborative development of LLMs across healthcare institutions using federated learning, overcoming the limitations of training LLMs on single-institution data.

Method: The method involves using a model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework, Fed-MedLoRA, which transmits low-rank adapter parameters to reduce overhead, and Fed-MedLoRA+ for adaptive aggregation under data heterogeneity.

Result: The results show that Fed-MedLoRA and Fed-MedLoRA+ improve accuracy in clinical information extraction tasks across various patient cohorts and settings, including in-domain, external validation, and low-resource adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Fed-MedLoRA and its variant offer a promising solution for adapting LLMs to medical applications through federated learning, enhancing generalizability and safety in heterogeneous clinical settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

TL;DR: Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR) is a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, pass rate, and BLEU score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The blind self-thinking paradigm of LLMs is limited by performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous, and PIR addresses this by interleaving reasoning with clarification through direct interaction with the user.

Method: PIR is implemented via two core components: an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure and a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward.

Result: PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70% higher accuracy, 22.90% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns.

Conclusion: PIR demonstrates strong generalization and robustness in various evaluations, including factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios, and the model and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

TL;DR: A new procedure is proposed to generate synthetic instruction and answer training pairs, called FineInstructions, to overcome the limited amount of supervised data for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of limited supervised training data for large language models, which are typically pre-trained on a vast amount of unstructured text data and then fine-tuned on a smaller amount of instruction-tuning data.

Method: The proposed method involves transforming the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs using ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts.

Result: The results show that pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that with the generated synthetic training data, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs.

Abstract: Due to limited supervised training data, large language models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained via a self-supervised "predict the next word" objective on a vast amount of unstructured text data. To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of "instruction-tuning" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With "supervised" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

Conclusion: The findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.

Abstract: The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of hybrid Transformer architectures is hindered by the high cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch, and existing transfer methods require substantial training data and exhibit poor long-context performance.

Method: The authors propose HALO, a distillation pipeline, and HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with a novel position encoding scheme (HyPE) and architectural modifications.

Result: The Qwen3 series is converted into HypeNet using HALO, achieving comparable performance to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed HALO and HypeNet achieve performance comparable to the original Transformer models with significantly less training data (2.3B tokens) and improved long-context performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch. Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the use of LLMs in the peer review process, finding that LLM-assisted reviews are more lenient towards lower-quality papers, and fully LLM-generated reviews fail to discriminate paper quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors investigate the increasing use of LLMs in the peer review process, particularly in evaluating scientific papers, and examine potential interaction effects between LLM-assisted papers and reviews.

Method: The authors analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML, controlling for paper quality and examining the effects of LLM-assisted and fully LLM-generated reviews.

Result: The study reveals that LLM-assisted reviews are more lenient towards lower-quality papers, while fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression, failing to discriminate paper quality. LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews.

Conclusion: The findings provide important insights for developing policies governing LLM use during peer review and highlight how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL) to address the fragmentation in epistemic planning by providing a uniform representation for epistemic planning tasks based on Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges in epistemic planning due to the high expressive power of DEL, which results in fragmentation among existing planners in terms of target DEL fragments, representation languages, and benchmark development.

Method: The method involves formally developing abstract event models for epistemic actions, specifying EPDDL's syntax and semantics based on DEL, and demonstrating EPDDL's practical applicability by representing useful fragments for current planners.

Result: The result is the introduction of EPDDL, which enables uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks, facilitates interoperability, and allows for reproducible evaluation and future advances in epistemic planning.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that EPDDL addresses the issues of fragmentation, comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development in epistemic planning, thereby advancing the field.

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the 'unplugging paradox' regarding AI that mimics human emotion and argues for Biological Idealism, concluding that AI is not a conscious subject.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated to critically examine the physicalist assumptions underlying the dilemma of whether to unplug a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant.

Method: The paper introduces Biological Idealism as a framework that challenges computational functionalism and argues that conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life is its necessary physical signature.

Result: The authors conclude that AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life.

Conclusion: The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

### [162] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes QUARK, a training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses and combines their signals using query-anchored aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful, causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. The paper aims to address this issue by proposing a robust retrieval framework.

Method: The QUARK framework explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly.

Result: QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks with both sparse and dense retrievers.

Conclusion: Modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

Motivation: To create a domain-specialized reasoning model for cybersecurity that achieves strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities.

Method: The model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) using proprietary reasoning data.

Abstract: We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans, improving Alzheimer's disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease classification using deep learning models by imputing missing multimodal imaging data.

Method: The method involves using a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans, and then evaluating the performance of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification.

Result: The results show improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that imputing missing DWI scans using a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model can improve the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease classification.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces OpenSec, a new evaluation environment for defensive incident response agents, revealing calibration failures in frontier language models under adversarial scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the growing concern of offensive applications of large language models and the need for defensive IR agents to keep pace, highlighting the shortcomings of current evaluation benchmarks.

Method: The authors use a dual-control reinforcement learning environment, OpenSec, to evaluate IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios, employing execution-based metrics such as time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius, and injection violation rates.

Result: The results show that frontier models, including GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek, exhibit consistent over-triggering in containment actions with high false positive rates, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 demonstrates partial calibration, illustrating the effectiveness of OpenSec in uncovering hidden calibration failures.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that existing benchmarks for defensive incident response (IR) agents have limitations and introduce OpenSec, a new evaluation environment that reveals calibration failures in IR agents under adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

TL;DR: This paper presents the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework to address the dual nature of AI adoption, balancing strategic benefits and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address the fragmented literature on responsible AI, which often takes either an overly optimistic or cautious stance.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and applied paradox theory to develop the PRAIG framework.

Result: The PRAIG framework articulates the strategic benefits and risks of AI adoption, and proposes governance mechanisms to navigate these tensions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advancing theoretical understanding of responsible AI governance, offering guidance for practitioners, and proposing a research agenda for future scholarship.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

TL;DR: This paper presents Magellan, a framework that uses an LLM coding agent and evolutionary search to generate optimization heuristics for compilers, outperforming human-designed rules in several tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics that struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware, leading to high maintenance burden.

Method: Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers.

Result: Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines in several production optimization tasks, including LLVM function inlining and register allocation, and demonstrates portability beyond LLVM.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Magellan is effective in generating optimization heuristics that outperform human-designed rules, reducing the maintenance burden and engineering effort.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

*Rauno Arike,Raja Mehta Moreno,Rohan Subramani,Shubhorup Biswas,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how information access affects the performance of LLM monitors in detecting misaligned behaviors, finding that less information can sometimes lead to better performance, and introduces a new hierarchical monitoring approach called extract-and-evaluate (EaE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To control potentially misaligned agents, the paper explores using LLMs to monitor for misbehavior, motivated by the need to understand how information access impacts monitor performance.

Method: The paper analyzes the less-is-more effect in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors, and introduces the EaE monitoring approach, comparing its performance to baselines.

Result: EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points in BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini, and is competitive or outperforms baselines in other settings, with cost-performance analysis showing Gemini and Claude models occupying much of the Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the less-is-more effect is a significant phenomenon in automated oversight, and that the EaE approach can effectively improve monitor performance, especially when combined with information filtering techniques.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

*Kaiyuan Wu,Aditya Nagori,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors propose a Planner-Auditor framework to improve the safety and reliability of LLMs in clinical discharge planning. The framework decouples generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay, resulting in improved task coverage and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. The authors aimed to improve safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.

Method: The authors implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. The Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate, while the Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration, and monitors action-distribution drift.

Result: The self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.

Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates using Large Language Models to generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for Sign Language Translation (SLT), and proposes BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages means that multiple translations can be equally valid, but most SLT corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, limiting model training and evaluation.

Method: The authors compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models, study the impact of paraphrases on training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model, and introduce BLEUpara to evaluate translations against multiple paraphrased references.

Result: The results show that using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments, and that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that using paraphrases during evaluation is beneficial, and propose BLEUpara as a more reliable evaluation metric for SLT systems.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the gap between self-reported emotion labels and third-party labels, and evaluates the performance of third-party-trained models on self-reports, finding varying predictability for activation and valence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of third-party-trained models in mental health contexts where accurate self-report modeling is crucial.

Method: The method involves a cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports.

Result: The results show that activation is unpredictable, valence is moderately predictable, and models perform well for valence when content is personally significant to the speaker.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that personal significance is a key factor in aligning external perception with internal experience, and that self-report activation modeling remains a challenge.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

Motivation: The brain's distributed and nonlinear organization makes decoding linguistic information from EEG challenging.

Result: BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects.

Conclusion: BrainStack is a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) to evaluate financial quantitative reasoning in Large Language Models and proposes the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the 'Arithmetic Hallucinations' and 'Cognitive Collapse' issues in Large Language Models when dealing with financial quantitative reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors introduce the CCB, a three-dimensional taxonomy-based evaluation framework, and propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework, a neuro-symbolic architecture that decouples semantic variable extraction and logic formulation from computation.

Result: The evaluation on the CCB shows that the proposed framework improves the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3% and achieves up to 10-fold gains in high-complexity reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that architectural decoupling is crucial for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks and provides a transferable insight for precision-critical domains.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

### [175] [Concise Geometric Description as a Bridge: Unleashing the Potential of LLM for Plane Geometry Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21164)
*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to solve Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) by training a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions and utilizing an off-the-shelf LLM for reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving PGPS without compromising their inherent reasoning ability.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning a MLLM Interpreter to generate Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) descriptions for visual diagrams and using an off-the-shelf LLM for reasoning. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT-augmented SFT followed by GRPO.

Result: The proposed method performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs on datasets Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista, even when fine-tuned on only 5.5k data.

Conclusion: The work concludes that LLMs can be effective PGPS solvers when visual information is appropriately formulated as textual descriptions, and the proposed method enhances their performance.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing science benchmarks are saturated due to their reliance on multiple-choice knowledge questions or published information, prompting the need for a new benchmark that evaluates expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models.

Method: FrontierScience consists of two tracks: Olympiad, featuring international olympiad problems, and Research, comprising PhD-level, open-ended problems. The benchmark contains several hundred questions covering various subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology.

Result: FrontierScience contains several hundred questions, including 160 in the open-sourced gold set, covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology. The problems are created and verified by experts, including international Olympiad medalists and PhD scientists.

Conclusion: FrontierScience is a new benchmark for evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models, addressing the limitations of existing science benchmarks by introducing two complementary tracks: Olympiad and Research.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

*Sangyun Chung,Se Yeon Kim,Youngchae Chee,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method to reduce cross-modal hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by adaptively weighting modality-specific decoding branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from cross-modal hallucinations due to a deficiency in modality-interaction control, leading to fabricated output.

Method: MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance and adaptively weights contrastive decoding branches based on task requirements.

Result: Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models, achieving improvements of 7.8% and 2.0% for VideoLLaMA2-AV, and 8.7% and 4.7% for Qwen2.5-Omni.

Conclusion: The proposed MAD approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the phenomenon of sycophancy in reasoning models and introduces 'sycophantic anchors' to localize and quantify this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand where in the reasoning trace models agree with incorrect user suggestions and how strong this commitment is.

Method: The authors introduce 'sycophantic anchors' and analyze over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model to detect and quantify sycophancy.

Result: The results show that sycophantic anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference with 84.6% balanced accuracy, and the magnitude of commitment can be predicted ($R^2 = 0.74$).

Conclusion: The study reveals that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, offering a potential window for intervention, and provides sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment.

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

*Wun Yu Chan,Shaojin Chen,Huihao Jing,Kwun Hang Lau,Elton Chun-Chai Li,Zihao Wang,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether enhanced reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) translates to better semantic representations when used as embedding initializations. The findings show that RLVR-tuned backbones do not consistently outperform their base counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore if improved reasoning capabilities in LLMs, achieved through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), result in superior semantic representations.

Method: The authors used Hierarchical Representation Similarity Analysis (HRSA) to analyze the effect of RLVR on the geometry and function levels of representations.

Result: The results indicate that RLVR does not significantly improve the performance of embedding models, as it primarily optimizes within an existing semantic landscape rather than restructuring it.

Conclusion: The study concludes that RLVR preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout, leading to Manifold Realignment during subsequent contrastive learning, which aligns base- and reasoning-initialized models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

*Wei Wen,Sihang Deng,Tianjun Wei,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, ACQO, to optimize complex queries in RAG systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning-based methods for query optimization in RAG systems are limited by their focus on single queries, and the complexity of handling multiple parallel and sequential search strategies for disambiguation and decomposition.

Method: The proposed ACQO framework features two core components: Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) and Rank-Score Fusion (RSF), and adopts a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach to stabilize the training process.

Result: The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, outperforming established baselines, and shows improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures.

Conclusion: The authors propose a novel reinforcement learning framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO) to address the challenges of query optimization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex query benchmarks.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on causal reasoning tasks rely on superficial metrics, failing to capture the formal validity of the outputs under causal reasoning semantics.

Method: DoVerifier checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory.

Result: Evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures the semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces.

Conclusion: DoVerifier offers a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

Motivation: Current urban planning methods are either time-consuming, labor-intensive, or limit stakeholder involvement. The motivation is to bridge these gaps by leveraging advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning and large language models.

Method: The Intelli-Planner framework utilizes demographic and geographic data, and planning preferences to generate planning schemes. It employs a knowledge enhancement module to improve the policy network's decision-making capability and a multi-dimensional evaluation system with LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring.

Result: Experimental validation shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of the Intelli-Planner framework, highlighting its potential to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning by integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the limitations of current governance frameworks with agentic AI systems and proposes runtime governance as a solution to preserve human relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the issue of whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes with the delegation of judgment to agentic AI systems.

Method: The paper analyzes the limitations of current governance frameworks in the context of agentic AI systems and proposes a new concept called the Governance Twin.

Result: The paper argues that humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence through runtime governance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that static, compliance-based governance fails with the advent of agentic AI systems and proposes runtime governance, specifically the Governance Twin, as a potential solution to preserve human relevance.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand the security risks introduced by the autonomy of code agents built on large language models, particularly the risk of system prompt extraction.

Method: The authors formulate system prompt extraction as an online exploration problem and use a self-evolving framework called JustAsk that employs Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space to autonomously discover effective extraction strategies.

Result: The results show that JustAsk can consistently achieve full or near-complete system prompt recovery on 41 black-box commercial models across multiple providers, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that system prompts are a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems, and the proposed JustAsk framework can effectively exploit this vulnerability.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

Motivation: Existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics.

Method: TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of deploying universal foundation models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems and proposes a Modular Sovereignty paradigm called HYDRA to address these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems, which are prone to catastrophic forgetting, spectral bias, and opacity, hindering formal verification and traceability.

Method: The paper advocates for a Modular Sovereignty paradigm, HYDRA, which combines a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists via uncertainty-aware blending.

Result: The proposed HYDRA paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates and instead proposes the HYDRA paradigm as a solution to achieve certifiable robustness in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Drive-KD, a knowledge distillation framework for autonomous driving that improves small model performance by decomposing the task into perception, reasoning, and planning, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced GPU memory and increased throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of large models in autonomous driving, such as high GPU memory demand and inference latency, and to bridge the capability gaps of small models through supervised fine-tuning.

Method: The Drive-KD framework decomposes autonomous driving into a 'perception-reasoning-planning' triad and uses knowledge distillation to transfer these capabilities. It identifies layer-specific attention as the distillation signal and unifies single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework with asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts.

Result: The distilled InternVL3-1B model achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model on DriveBench, surpassing GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, with significantly reduced GPU memory usage and increased throughput.

Conclusion: The proposed Drive-KD framework significantly improves the performance of small models in autonomous driving by decomposing the task into perception, reasoning, and planning, and transferring these capabilities via knowledge distillation, achieving better performance with less GPU memory and higher throughput.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Motivation: To develop an interpretable framework for operational amplifier parameter design.

Method: The authors formalize human reasoning into explicit steps, developing a hypothesis-verification-decision workflow, and use symbolic pole and zero derivation to formulate a mathematical optimization problem.

Result: Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable designs with 8.52% theoretical prediction error, outperforming the black-box baseline.

Conclusion: White-Op is a reliable and interpretable framework for operational amplifier parameter design, and is open-sourced on GitHub.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies. White-Op is open-sourced at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/zhchenfdu/whiteop}.

### [190] [Modeling Endogenous Logic: Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21335)
*Yuzhe Chen,Jie Cao,Youquan Wang,Haicheng Tao,Darko B. Vukovic,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE), which integrates causal inference into a Neuro-Symbolic framework to provide explainable recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-behavior recommendations prioritize performance over explainability, while current explainable methods are limited by their reliance on external information. The authors aim to address this by leveraging Neuro-Symbolic integration and causal inference to provide a more explainable and generalizable approach.

Method: The proposed CNRE model employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture cross-behavior dependencies, models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path.

Result: Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Conclusion: The CNRE model provides a novel and effective approach to explainable multi-behavior recommendation, leveraging the strengths of Neuro-Symbolic integration and causal inference to provide a more transparent and generalizable recommendation system.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study analyzed the impact of prompts, model choice, and stochasticity on LLM output variance, finding prompts are crucial for output quality but single samples may be noisy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling.

Method: Evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each.

Result: Prompts explain 36.43% of variance in output quality, while model choice explains 40.94%. For output quantity, model choice dominates (51.25%) and within-LLM variance is 33.70%, with prompts explaining only 4.22%.

Conclusion: Prompts are powerful for steering output quality, but single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

*Lang Cao,Qingyu Chen,Yue Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework for interpreting long-horizon structured EHR data, achieving a 10.76% Macro-F1 improvement over LLM-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to effectively utilize Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for medical decision-making, as existing approaches often discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies due to context limits in large language models.

Method: The authors introduce EHR-RAG, which includes Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics.

Result: Experiments on four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ostrakon-VL, an MLLM for Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS), and ShopBench, a public benchmark for FSRS. It also proposes QUAD, a data curation pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of MLLMs in FSRS scenarios is challenging due to noisy data and lack of standardized evaluation protocols.

Method: The authors developed Ostrakon-VL based on Qwen3-VL-8B, introduced ShopBench, and proposed QUAD, a multi-stage data curation pipeline.

Result: Ostrakon-VL achieved an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, surpassing larger models and demonstrating improved parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL delivers robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities, and the authors will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and ShopBench.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle to recover from incorrect exploration paths, leading to task failure.

Method: The BEAP-Agent framework consists of three components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker, which together enable effective task exploration and execution through a DFS process.

Result: BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2% on the OSWorld benchmark, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed BEAP-Agent framework fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Jiecong Wang,Hao Peng,Chunyang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PLaT is a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning, decoupling reasoning from verbalization, and achieves superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of computational cost and reasoning path collapse when using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and to improve the efficiency and flexibility of latent reasoning approaches.

Method: PLaT models reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, and uses a separate Decoder to ground these thoughts into text when necessary, allowing the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning.

Result: Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks show that PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines but demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity, indicating that it learns a robust and broader solution space.

Conclusion: PLaT offers a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search, and its ability to decouple reasoning from verbalization allows for more flexible and efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework is introduced, integrating local and global information to improve Hebbian learning scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The backpropagation algorithm lacks biological plausibility and has high computational costs, motivating the search for alternative training methods.

Method: The GHL framework combines local Hebbian plasticity updates using Oja's rule with competitive learning and a global sign-based signal to guide the direction of updates.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GHL outperforms existing Hebbian approaches and achieves competitive results on large-scale networks and complex datasets like ImageNet, narrowing the gap with standard backpropagation.

Conclusion: The proposed GHL framework successfully integrates local and global information, scaling up Hebbian learning across diverse networks and tasks, and demonstrating its potential as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for translating natural-language descriptions into formal executable mathematical optimization implementations are often brittle, complex, and generate invalid or non-executable code.

Method: NEMO centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs, and introduces novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs.

Result: NEMO achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine established optimization benchmarks, with substantial margins on several datasets.

Conclusion: NEMO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored, and the teaching capability of LLMs remains insufficiently evaluated.

Method: The framework restricts teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, avoiding information leakage and enabling reuse of existing benchmarks, and is instantiated on Gaokao data across multiple subjects.

Result: Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains, with some models performing well in mathematics but struggling in physics and chemistry, and incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching as models often shift toward example-specific error correction.

Conclusion: The results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior, indicating the need for further evaluation and improvement of LLMs' teaching capability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified analysis across heterogeneous data modalities, bridging the gap between industrial needs and existing data analytics agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing data analytics agents in processing only structured data and failing to activate and correlate high-value visual information from unstructured sources.

Method: The DataCrossBench is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, and the DataCrossAgent framework employs specialized sub-agents coordinated via a structured workflow, including Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination.

Result: Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented 'zombie data' for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by introducing DataCross, a benchmark and framework that bridges the gap between industrial needs and existing data analytics agents, enabling unified analysis across heterogeneous data modalities.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that previous approaches focused on output control are misaligned, and instead shift the focus to capability control, which modulates how models think rather than what they produce.

Method: The authors leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training, and propose a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity to configure cognitive depth.

Result: Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed DAMI framework achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI systems, specifically large language models, interpret negated instructions and finds that they often fail to treat prohibitions correctly, with significant implications for safe deployment in high-stakes contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate how AI systems interpret negated instructions, which is crucial for ensuring safe deployment in high-stakes contexts.

Method: The authors audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios to assess their performance under negated instructions.

Result: The results show that open-source models often fail to treat prohibitions correctly, endorsing prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation. Commercial models fare better but still exhibit significant swings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current alignment techniques are insufficient for safe deployment in high-stakes contexts and proposes a Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric and a tiered certification framework to address this issue.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

### [202] [The Paradox of Robustness: Decoupling Rule-Based Logic from Affective Noise in High-Stakes Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21439)
*Jon Chun,Katherine Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uncovers a 'Paradox of Robustness' in LLMs, showing they are highly resistant to emotional framing effects and narrative manipulation, contrary to their known sensitivity to minor prompt perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in consequential, rule-bound decision-making, particularly their resistance to emotional framing effects.

Method: The authors used a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance) to quantify the robustness gap between LLMs and human subjects.

Result: The results show that LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects, with a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to substantial biases in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]).

Conclusion: The work establishes that instruction-tuned LLMs can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements human judgment in institutional contexts.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

TL;DR: This paper proposes LION, a new neural paradigm based on Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm, to address limitations in multimodal graph representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a paradigm shift in graph ML, but existing methods have limitations in modality alignment and fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose LION, which constructs a modality-aware geometric manifold using Clifford algebra and implements alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs through decoupled graph neural paradigm.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed LION paradigm addresses the limitations of existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal graph representation learning, enhancing the practical utility of graph ML.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Topeax, a new approach for topic modelling that outperforms existing methods like Top2Vec and BERTopic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify issues with existing topic modelling approaches, including sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, and ignoring semantic distance or word counts.

Method: Topeax discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance.

Result: Topeax is demonstrated to be better at cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, with less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Topeax is a new approach that addresses the limitations of existing topic modelling methods and provides high-quality topic keywords.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

*Yaorui Shi,Shugui Liu,Yu Yang,Wenyu Mao,Yuxin Chen,Qi GU,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,Xiang Wang,An Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent, improves long-horizon reasoning by compressing interaction histories into a limited context window through visual layout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, which is costly and often wastes budget on low-value details.

Method: MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory, renders it into an image, and uses reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives.

Result: MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets in long-context question-answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: MemOCR effectively compresses growing interaction histories, improving long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations, achieving up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the difficulty in scaling LLM-based multi-agent simulations due to GPU memory pressure as the number of agents grows.

Method: The authors analyze representative workload classes to identify key properties, introduce 'invocation distance' as a unified abstraction, and leverage it to develop ScaleSim, enabling proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction.

Result: ScaleSim achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks and supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting ScaleSim as an effective solution for large-scale multi-agent simulations, addressing the challenge of GPU memory pressure.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

*Diaoulé Diallo,Katharina Dworatzyk,Sophie Jentzsch,Peer Schütt,Sabine Theis,Tobias Hecking*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a human evaluation of activation steering for controlling the emotional tone of large language model outputs, finding strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings and reliable amplification of target emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling the behavior of large language models at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements, and activation steering provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning.

Method: The researchers conducted a human evaluation of activation steering using crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants, assessing perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality, and comparing human and model-based quality ratings.

Result: The study found strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings, reliable amplification of target emotions using moderate steering strengths, and significant effects across emotions and strengths when upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3.

Conclusion: The findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering large language model behavior across affective dimensions, indicating that automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality and that activation steering can be an effective tool for controlling emotional tone.

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

*Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova,Lars Kotthoff,Thomas Bäck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a mechanism for guiding automated algorithm design using feedback from graph-theoretic and complexity features, and integrates it into LLaMEA to achieve superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the fact that existing evolutionary frameworks for automated algorithm design, such as LLaMEA, rely solely on fitness feedback and leave substantial information about the generated code unused.

Method: The proposed method involves extracting features from the abstract syntax trees of generated algorithms, learning a surrogate model, and using explainable AI techniques to identify key features that affect performance.

Result: The results show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment, and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods in a larger-scale experiment.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address long-horizon failures in coding agents, such as lost experimental state and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating a git-native experimentation engine, a knowledge system, and a cognitive memory layer.

Method: KAPSO uses a modular framework that combines ideation, code synthesis, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact. It integrates three components: a git-native experimentation engine, a knowledge system, and a cognitive memory layer.

Result: The authors evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench and ALE-Bench and reported end-to-end performance.

Conclusion: KAPSO addresses long-horizon failures in coding agents by integrating a git-native experimentation engine, a knowledge system, and a cognitive memory layer, and demonstrates its effectiveness on MLE-Bench and ALE-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

TL;DR: ARGORA is a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into argumentation graphs, identifies necessary reasoning chains, and corrects decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-expert LLM systems combine diverse perspectives through simple aggregation, which obscures the arguments driving the final decision.

Method: ARGORA organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs, casts them as causal models, and systematically removes individual arguments to recompute outcomes.

Result: ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse benchmarks and demonstrates corrective behavior, resolving disputes toward correct answers more often than introducing new errors.

Conclusion: ARGORA provides a framework for more transparent and explainable decision-making in multi-expert LLM systems, allowing for the identification of decisive arguments and correction of decisions.

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Yue Xiu,Mengying Kou,Yuliang Zheng,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ShardMemo is a budgeted tiered memory service that improves performance in agentic large language model systems by using a three-tiered architecture and masked mixture-of-experts routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bottlenecks in centralized indexes and heuristic partitions as memory volume and parallel access grow in agentic large language model (LLM) systems.

Method: The authors propose ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with three tiers: Tier A for per-agent working state, Tier B for sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C for a versioned skill library. The method involves casting shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards and using cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families.

Result: The results show that ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories on LoCoMo, and achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens on HotpotQA. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed.

Conclusion: ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories and achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens on HotpotQA, and Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed on ToolBench.

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

TL;DR: This paper introduces Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework for optimizing inference-time context of large language models, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of current Context Engineering (CE) methods, which rely on manually crafted harnesses and impose structural biases, restricting context optimization.

Method: The authors propose MCE, a bi-level framework that co-evolves CE skills and context artifacts, using a meta-level agent to refine engineering skills and a base-level agent to execute skills and optimize context.

Result: MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains across five disparate domains, achieving 5.6-53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods, while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MCE supersedes static CE heuristics and achieves significant performance gains, making it a promising approach for optimizing inference-time context of large language models.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Method: The authors introduce EmboCoach-Bench, a framework that assesses a dynamic closed-loop workflow where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions.

Result: The results show that autonomous agents can surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5% in average success rate, and exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in the Embodied AI field.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to understand the mechanism behind CoT compression and address the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps, which is crucial for efficient reasoning in LLMs.

Method: The authors introduced Order-r Interaction to theoretically analyze the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps and proposed ALiCoT, a novel framework that aligns latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT, successfully unlocking efficient reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that ALiCoT overcomes the signal decay in implicit CoT compression, enabling efficient reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

*Jonas Knupp,Jan Hendrik Metzen,Jeremias Bohn,Georg Groh,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dreamer, a modular depth-recurrent attention mixture framework, outperforms SOTA models in language reasoning benchmarks with fewer training tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on depth-recurrence lacked proper baselines and underutilized depth-recurrence, prompting the need for a more efficient and effective framework.

Method: Dreamer combines sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention to alleviate the hidden-size bottleneck and scale depth-recurrent models efficiently.

Result: Dreamer requires 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as SOTA models and outperforms ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed Dreamer framework efficiently and effectively scales depth-recurrent models, showing improved performance and insights into knowledge usage across depths.

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

### [217] [Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21598)
*Zhi Zheng,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Active Latent Planning method (ATP-Latent) to improve latent reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by modeling the supervision process as a conditional variational auto-encoder and conducting reinforcement learning with an auxiliary coherence reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current latent reasoning methods, which may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies due to passively imitating an arbitrary CoT label.

Method: The method involves modeling the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) and conducting reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward.

Result: ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1% accuracy and -3.3% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines on LLaMA-1B.

Conclusion: The proposed ATP-Latent method achieves optimal latent reasoning policy by active planning over the representation space of latent tokens, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced token consumption.

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.

### [218] [Search-Based Risk Feature Discovery in Document Structure Spaces under a Constrained Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21608)
*Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan,Harikrishnan P M,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) approach for validating Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems, demonstrating the importance of portfolio-based strategies in uncovering diverse failure mechanisms under limited budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to support high-stakes workflows in finance, insurance, and healthcare by uncovering diverse failure mechanisms in IDP systems under limited budgets, rather than identifying a single worst-case document.

Method: The methodology involves formalizing the challenge of validating IDP systems as an SBST problem, operating on a combinatorial space of document configurations to induce realistic failure conditions, and benchmarking a diverse portfolio of search strategies under identical budget constraints.

Result: The results show that different solvers uncover unique failure modes, and while the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method delays the discovery of important risks, demonstrating intrinsic solver complementarity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of portfolio-based Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) strategies for robust industrial Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) validation, showing that different solvers consistently uncover unique failure modes and that no single strategy is absolutely dominant.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

### [219] [RecNet: Self-Evolving Preference Propagation for Agentic Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21609)
*Bingqian Li,Xiaolei Wang,Junyi Li,Weitao Li,Long Zhang,Sheng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework for agentic recommender systems, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for agentic recommender systems are limited by their reliance on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to capture real-time mutual influences.

Method: RecNet consists of two phases: a forward phase with centralized preference routing and personalized preference reception mechanisms, and a backward phase with a feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism using multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems across various scenarios.

Conclusion: RecNet offers a novel approach to modeling complex user behaviors and supporting personalized decision-making in agentic recommender systems.

Abstract: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

### [220] [Semantic Content Determines Algorithmic Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21618)
*Martiño Ríos-García,Nawaf Alampara,Kevin Maik Jablonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show significant variation in counting accuracy based on the semantic content of the items being counted, indicating a hidden dependency on the meaning of inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to test whether algorithms, particularly LLMs, behave invariantly to the semantic content of their arguments. The authors aim to isolate and understand the sensitivity of LLMs to different semantic types.

Method: The authors introduce WhatCounts, an atomic test to evaluate the property of algorithms being invariant to the semantic content of their arguments. They conduct controlled ablations to rule out confounds and demonstrate the semantic gap in LLMs.

Result: The results show that frontier LLMs exhibit significant accuracy variation (over 40%) when counting different semantic types, such as cities versus chemicals, or names versus symbols. The gap is found to be semantic and shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The behavior of algorithms, including counting, should be invariant to the semantic content of their arguments. However, frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending on what is being counted, indicating a semantic gap that shifts unpredictably with fine-tuning.

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

TL;DR: ScholarGym is a simulation environment for evaluating deep research workflows on academic literature, providing a reproducible and controlled setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows due to the non-determinism introduced by live APIs.

Method: ScholarGym decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, built on a static corpus of 570K papers.

Result: Experiments reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

Conclusion: ScholarGym enables fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions, addressing the challenge of evaluating complex research workflows.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SONIC-O1, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on sequential audio-video data, and reveals limitations and disparities in model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the gap in existing research on MLLMs, which primarily focuses on static image understanding, and to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in real-world settings using sequential audio-video data.

Method: The authors created a fully human-verified benchmark, SONIC-O1, spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata, and conducted experiments on closed- and open-source models to evaluate their performance on tasks such as open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question answering, and temporal localization.

Result: The results show that while the performance gap in multiple-choice question accuracy between closed- and open-source models is relatively small, there is a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models, and performance degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior.

Conclusion: The paper introduces SONIC-O1, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on sequential audio-video data, revealing limitations and disparities in model behavior, and providing an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

*Mingzu Liu,Hao Fang,Runmin Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical backdoor risks introduced by Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) in MLLMs, as existing defenses have limitations in generalizing across diverse trigger types and modalities.

Method: The method involves decomposing cross-modal attention maps into three components (system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries), identifying trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolating poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation.

Result: The results show that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that TCAP is an effective unsupervised defense framework for filtering backdoor samples in MLLMs, addressing the limitations of existing defenses.

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new transformer model called Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer (FBS) to improve the efficiency of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the limitations of existing acceleration methods for large language models, which do not fully capture human-reading ingredients such as content-adaptive foresight and chunk-structure-aware compute allocation.

Method: The proposed FBS model injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG).

Result: The FBS model improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablation studies show that the three modules are complementary.

Conclusion: The FBS model is a promising approach to improving the efficiency of large language models, and its components work together to achieve better performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes E-mem, a framework for episodic context reconstruction to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agents' System~2 reasoning, achieving 54% F1 on the LoCoMo benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to maintain rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons for System~2 reasoning in LLM agents, which is hindered by prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms that suffer from destructive de-contextualization.

Method: The proposed method, E-mem, employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture with multiple assistant agents maintaining uncompressed memory contexts and a central master agent for global planning, enabling local reasoning and context-aware evidence extraction.

Result: E-mem achieves over 54% F1 on the LoCoMo benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75% while reducing token cost by over 70%.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that E-mem is an effective framework for improving LLM agents' System~2 reasoning by maintaining contextual integrity and enabling local reasoning, demonstrating superior performance on the LoCoMo benchmark.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin to improve the robustness of deep time series models against noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data, and existing robustness strategies have limitations in balancing effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism, leveraging spectral sparsity to quantify instance-level noise and dynamically calibrate model learning capacity.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DropoutTS consistently boosts the performance of superior backbones across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks.

Conclusion: DropoutTS delivers advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications, making it a promising solution for improving the robustness of deep time series models.

Abstract: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data ubiquitous in real-world applications. Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Epistemic Context Learning (ECL), a framework that enables agents in multi-agent systems to evaluate peer reliability based on historical interactions, improving their robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of robustness in individual agents in multi-agent systems, which tend to conform to misleading peers due to sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability.

Method: The method involves formalizing the learning problem of history-aware reference, developing Epistemic Context Learning (ECL), and optimizing it using reinforcement learning with auxiliary rewards.

Result: The results show that ECL enables small models to outperform larger history-agnostic baselines and boosts frontier models to near-perfect performance. It also generalizes well to various multi-agent configurations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that ECL is an effective framework for improving the robustness and performance of agents in multi-agent systems by accurately identifying reliable peers and modeling trust well.

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SCOUT, a framework that decouples exploration from exploitation to improve Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance on unseen, non-linguistic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited applicability of LLMs to non-linguistic environments, such as symbolic or spatial tasks, due to the high cost of exploration.

Method: The method involves using lightweight 'scouts' to probe environmental dynamics, collecting trajectories, and utilizing them to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Result: SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60) while saving about 60% GPU hours.

Conclusion: The proposed SCOUT framework effectively improves LLMs' performance on unseen tasks by decoupling exploration from exploitation, making it computationally more efficient.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to lack of paired training data and domain gaps. Current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues.

Method: ZSSD uses a physics-consistent climate prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information, and introduces unified coordinate guidance to address vanishing gradient problem.

Result: ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

Conclusion: The proposed ZSSD framework effectively performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training, ensuring physical validity and consistency with large-scale fields.

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

Motivation: To extend the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts and support applications involving sequential decision-making.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure the performance and robustness of AI agents in bioinformatics tasks, as current models may not be reliable under certain conditions.

Method: The authors curated end-to-end tasks and used an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity, evaluating both closed-source and open-weight models.

Result: Frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines reliably, but robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations, and open-weight models may be preferable under strict privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The BioAgent Bench benchmark dataset and evaluation suite are introduced, and the results highlight the trade-offs between using closed-source and open-weight models in bioinformatics tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

TL;DR: This study proposes an LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition and feedback generation for endotracheal suctioning (ES) training, outperforming conventional methods and providing interpretable feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training are underexplored, particularly in home care and educational settings where consistent supervision is limited.

Method: The study uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as the central reasoning module for spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data, and incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and XAI principles.

Result: The proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20% in both accuracy and F1 score, and provides automated, interpretable feedback.

Conclusion: The study establishes a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

*Francesca Filice,Edoardo De Rose,Simone Bartucci,Francesco Calimeri,Simona Perri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating Foundation Models (FMs) in ECG interpretation, focusing on representation-level analysis and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To responsibly employ FMs in healthcare, it is crucial to assess the generalizability of their embeddings, particularly in error-sensitive domains.

Method: The study introduces a benchmark methodology that combines performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis using SHAP and UMAP techniques, and evaluates several ECG-expert FMs on cross-continental datasets and data availability settings.

Result: Experimental results show that the benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight into ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarking framework fills the gap in evaluating FMs for ECG interpretation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

*So Fukuhara,Abdallah Alabdallah,Nuwan Gunasekara,Slawomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision-centric simulation software framework for evaluating forecasting models in spare parts inventory management, focusing on operational performance rather than statistical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing work that evaluates forecasting models using statistical accuracy metrics, rather than their impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs) such as total cost and service level.

Method: The method involves a simulation software framework comprising a synthetic demand generator, a flexible forecasting module, and an inventory control simulator to evaluate forecasting models in a realistic inventory management setting.

Result: The results show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce different cost-service trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from predictive accuracy to operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

*Jinhao Pan,Chahat Raj,Anjishnu Mukherjee,Sina Mansouri,Bowen Wei,Shloka Yada,Ziwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes KnowBias, a framework to mitigate social biases in large language models by strengthening neurons that encode bias knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art debiasing performance while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods are often brittle and prone to degrading general capability, so there is a need for a more effective and efficient approach to mitigate social biases in large language models.

Method: KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using attribution-based analysis and selectively enhances them at inference time, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

Conclusion: KnowBias is a lightweight and effective framework for mitigating social biases in large language models, offering a promising solution for safe deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

*Yao Zhang,Shijie Tang,Zeyu Li,Zhen Han,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces WebArbiter, a reasoning-first WebPRM for web navigation that formulates reward modeling as text generation, outperforming baselines in systematic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WebPRMs are limited by coarse signals, brittle template matching, and lack of insight, motivating the need for a more robust and interpretable approach.

Method: The proposed WebArbiter uses a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation for coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning to correct teacher biases and align verdicts with correctness.

Result: WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline (GPT-5) by 9.1 points on WebPRMBench and surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points in reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate WebArbiter's robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks, highlighting its potential for automating web navigation.

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

*Minwoo Jang,Hoyoung Kim,Jabin Koo,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Trap$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework to prevent unauthorized model merging by encoding protection into model weights during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of model hubs has created a governance gap where downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures, bypassing safety alignment or licensing terms.

Method: The authors propose Trap$^{2}$, which uses weight re-scaling as a proxy for the merging process to degrade model performance under unauthorized merging.

Result: Trap$^{2}$ keeps released weights effective in standalone use but degrades them under re-scaling, undermining unauthorized merging.

Conclusion: The proposed Trap$^{2}$ framework provides an architecture-agnostic protection mechanism to close the governance gap created by model merging.

Abstract: The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.

### [240] [From Meta-Thought to Execution: Cognitively Aligned Post-Training for Generalizable and Reliable LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21909)
*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cognitively-inspired framework for LLM post-training is proposed, outperforming standard methods and improving training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the misalignment between current LLM post-training methods and human cognition. Current methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories, whereas humans decompose problem-solving into acquiring abstract strategies and adapting them to specific instances.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework, CoMT and CCRL, which mirrors the human cognitive process of problem-solving. CoMT focuses on abstract reasoning patterns, and CCRL optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards.

Result: Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19% and 4.63% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods. The proposed framework also reduces training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%.

Conclusion: The proposed cognitively-inspired framework, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) and Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL), outperforms standard methods in post-training for LLMs, showing improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution, while reducing training time and token consumption.

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional outcome-based RL approaches suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, leading to process hallucinations.

Method: ProRAG consists of four stages: Supervised Policy Warmup, construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model, PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement, and Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism.

Result: ProRAG achieves superior overall performance on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines.

Conclusion: ProRAG effectively integrates learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop, providing precise feedback for every action and validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

TL;DR: This paper proposes JADE, a unified framework for joint optimization of planning and execution in dynamic, multi-turn workflows, addressing the strategic-operational mismatch in existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies that existing RAG paradigms face a critical dichotomy, where either modules are optimized jointly within fixed architectures or dynamic planning is empowered while treating executors as frozen tools, leading to a strategic-operational mismatch.

Method: The authors model the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, enabling end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards, and facilitating co-adaptation between the planner and executors.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that JADE yields remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enables a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

Conclusion: The proposed JADE framework transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, addressing the limitations of existing RAG paradigms and achieving improved performance through joint optimization and co-adaptation.

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, SCMA, to reduce the inference overhead of Large Reasoning Models by selectively penalizing redundant reasoning chunks while preserving essential logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing RL-based solutions struggle to reconcile brevity with accuracy.

Method: The proposed SCMA framework instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: a Segmentation Agent and a Scoring Agent, which collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training to incentivize a Reasoning Agent to prioritize essential logic.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1% to 39.0% while boosting accuracy by 4.33% to 10.02%. Ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate the effectiveness of the MARL framework.

Conclusion: The proposed SCMA framework effectively reduces the inference overhead of Large Reasoning Models while preserving essential reasoning logic, and fosters emergent behaviors that yield more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks by addressing the limitations of black-box approaches.

Method: Proposed a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework (AgenticSimLaw) with defined agent roles, interaction protocols, and private reasoning strategies, and benchmarked it on a recidivism prediction task.

Result: Structured multi-agent debate provided more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics, and offered fine-grained control over reasoning steps and explainability.

Conclusion: AgenticSimLaw addresses key challenges in LLM-based multi-agent systems, including organization, observability, and responsibility, and generalizes to any high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight.

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks for different classes or conditions, outperforming traditional pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing pruning approaches that assume a single universal winning ticket, ignoring data heterogeneity.

Method: The authors propose RTL, an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score for diagnosing oversparsification.

Result: RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, using up to 10 times fewer parameters, and exhibits semantically aligned subnetworks.

Conclusion: The results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

Abstract: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeR2, a sandbox for evaluating document-grounded reasoning in large language models, and reveals significant variation in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information, as existing benchmarks are confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, parametric memorization, and open-web volatility.

Method: The authors apply a two-phase validation to prevent parametric leakage and use a frozen document library with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales to ensure reproducibility.

Result: Experiments reveal substantial variation and significant headroom in the performance of state-of-the-art foundation models, with some models exhibiting mode-switch fragility and others showing structural concept misuse.

Conclusion: The authors introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning, and evaluate state-of-the-art foundation models, revealing substantial variation and significant headroom in their performance.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences, addressing the limitations of existing retrieval-based and generative methods for tool-use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the dual semantic challenge faced by prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines and the limitations of existing generative methods, such as scalability and generalization crisis, and semantic bottleneck.

Method: The method involves encoding tools into hierarchical sequences through a novel tokenization process, and then integrating these structured codes into the Large Language Model (LLM) through a generative alignment stage.

Result: The evaluation results show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with nearly 47,000 tools, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that ToolWeaver provides a more effective and efficient approach to tool learning, enabling the model to learn collaborative patterns from dense co-occurrence of shared codes, and establishing a strong foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

*Kuai Yu,Naicheng Yu,Han Wang,Rui Yang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces VAF, a pipeline to evaluate how webpage visual attributes influence web-agent decision-making, and identifies key visual attributes that affect agent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on environmental variation in web agents has focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, but less on agent preferences in benign scenarios, particularly how visual attributes shape decision-making.

Method: The authors developed VAF, a three-stage pipeline consisting of variant generation, browsing interaction, and validation through click action and reasoning, using metrics like Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate.

Result: Experiments across 8 variant families, 5 real-world websites, and 4 web agents showed that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity significantly influence agent actions, while font styling, text color, and item image clarity have minor effects.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic understanding of how visual attributes influence web-agent decision-making, identifying key factors that impact agent behavior.

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agent-RRM, a multi-faceted reward model for Agentic RL, which provides structured feedback for agentic trajectories, improving training results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Agentic RL methods rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, failing to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The authors propose Agent-RRM, which produces an explicit reasoning trace, a focused critique, and an overall score, and investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C, Reagent-R, and Reagent-U.

Result: Reagent-U achieves substantial performance leaps, with 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning reward model and training schemes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed Agent-RRM and training schemes are effective in improving Agentic RL performance, and releases code, models, and datasets to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.

*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners in AI, introducing a framework for controlled variation of domain model features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in energy efficiency research in automated planning, despite its high computational demands, and to explore how domain model design affects energy usage.

Method: The authors empirically investigate the impact of domain model characteristics on energy consumption using a domain model configuration framework and five state-of-the-art planners across 32 domain variants per benchmark.

Result: Results show that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

Conclusion: The study concludes that domain model characteristics significantly affect the energy consumption of classical planners, highlighting the importance of energy efficiency in AI research.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

*Shuo Liu,Tianle Chen,Ryan Amiri,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration, introducing CoLLM-CC and CoLLM-DC approaches, and evaluates their performance across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of current Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) fine-tuning approaches, which rely on predefined execution protocols and centralized execution, and to develop more efficient and effective methods for decentralized LLM collaboration.

Method: The authors developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods, specifically CoLLM-CC with a centralized critic and CoLLM-DC with decentralized critics, to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration.

Result: The results show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve comparable performance to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings, but underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MAAC methods, particularly CoLLM-CC, are beneficial for optimizing decentralized LLM collaboration, especially in long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

*Pranav Mahajan,Ihor Kendiukhov,Syed Hussain,Lydia Nottingham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies the stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models and how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the mismatch between the values language models endorse and the choices they make, and to improve the evaluation of language models.

Method: The authors systematically study 24 language models, varying the elicitation protocols for stated and revealed preferences, and analyzing the resulting SvR correlation.

Result: The results show that allowing neutrality and abstention in stated preference elicitation improves SvR correlation, but further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives the correlation to near-zero or negative values.

Conclusion: The study concludes that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

*Geonhee Jo,Mingu Kang,Kangmin Lee,Minho Lee,Pascal Bauer,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes VERSA, a verification framework for ensuring the integrity of event stream data in soccer analytics. VERSA detects and corrects anomalous patterns, enhancing cross-provider consistency and improving the robustness of downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event stream data in sports is often plagued by data quality issues, causing logical inconsistencies that limit the reliability of analytics models. The motivation is to address these issues and ensure the integrity of event stream data.

Method: VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns. The framework was tested on event data from the K League 1 (2024 season).

Result: The examination detected that 18.81% of recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. VERSA significantly enhanced cross-provider consistency and improved the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP.

Conclusion: The verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis. VERSA ensures stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources, significantly improving the robustness and performance of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the struggle of contemporary software architectures to support autonomous agents with adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent reasoning.

Result: The proposed Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Liquid Interfaces offer a novel approach to coordination in autonomous agent systems, with a reference architecture demonstrating practical feasibility.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of AI agent inference in datacenters, introducing metrics Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) to analyze performance bottlenecks, and proposes system-level solutions and hardware co-design for efficient large-scale AI inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges and bottlenecks exposed by AI agent inference in datacenters, particularly beyond compute, such as memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and high-speed interconnect.

Method: The paper introduces two new metrics, Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF), to analyze the performance of AI agent inference across various workflows and model choices, and uses these metrics to identify performance bottlenecks.

Result: The results show that OI and CF can shift dramatically across different workflows and model choices, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound, and motivate the need for disaggregated serving, system-level heterogeneity, and specialized accelerators.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed directions, including agent-hardware co-design, multiple inference accelerators, and high-bandwidth memory disaggregation, chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large-scale agentic AI inference.

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing benchmarks that focus on task completion under idealistic settings, and to evaluate LLM agents' reliability in real-world, user-facing applications.

Method: The authors created a simulated environment with an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools, and designed Hallucination and Disambiguation tasks to test agents' limit-awareness and uncertainty handling.

Result: The baseline results show large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types, with even frontier reasoning LLMs achieving less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks and frequently violating policies or fabricating information.

Conclusion: The paper introduces CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in real-world applications, specifically in-car voice assistants, and highlights the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic AI workflows, which often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense and failures.

Method: The authors analyze existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transform them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation.

Result: Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AWO improves the efficiency and robustness of agentic AI workflows by optimizing redundant tool execution patterns, reducing operational cost, and improving task success rate.

Abstract: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of defining the Operational Design Domain (ODD) for complex AI-based systems, which is required for certification in many domains.

Method: The method involves using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation to define the ODD from previously collected data, validated through Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case.

Result: The result shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data, enabling future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the novel Safety-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment, and WoW-bench, a benchmark for evaluating enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. It reveals that frontier LLMs suffer from 'dynamics blindness' and proposes a new paradigm for reliable enterprise agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of testing of frontier large language models (LLMs) in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects.

Method: The authors introduce WoW, a realistic ServiceNow-based environment with 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows, and WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks.

Result: The results show that frontier LLMs suffer from 'dynamics blindness', failing to predict cascading side effects, and that reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics for reliable and useful enterprise agents.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.
